Objective and subjective assessments were made to evaluate the degree of discomfort and interferences to the use of senses. The study revealed that factors such as breathing resistance, work-rate and activity period affected the physiological responses. The weight of the respirator and the skin temperature had no direct relationship with the cardiovascular stress. Positive-pressure respirators that gave lower face temperatures than negative-pressure masks gave this type of respirator an additional advantage in hot environments. Respirators that restricted jaw movement affected the speech intelligibility of the wearer. Orinasal masks restricted vision more than the other types. The problem of fit was found negligible though head and face dimensions significantly differed between the British and the Sri Lankans. Subjective assessment correlated well with objective tests.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined adaptive responses to auditory perturbation of fundamental frequency (fo) in speakers with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and control speakers. Method Sixteen speakers with PD and nineteen control speakers produced sustained vowels while they received perturbed auditory feedback (i.e., fo shifted upward or downward). Speakers’ pitch acuity was quantified using a just-noticeable-difference (JND) paradigm. Twelve listeners provided estimates of the speech intelligibility for speakers with PD. Results Fifteen responses from each speaker group for each shift direction were included in analyses. While control speakers generally showed consistent adaptive responses opposing the perturbation, speakers with PD showed no compensation on average, with individual PD speakers showing highly variable responses. In the PD group, the degree of compensation was not significantly correlated with age, disease progression, pitch acuity, or intelligibility. Conclusions These findings indicate reduced adaptation to sustained fo perturbation and higher variability in PD compared to control participants. No significant differences were seen in pitch acuity between groups, suggesting that the fo adaptation deficit in PD is not the result of purely perceptual mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Methods. Twelve healthy older adults (six females) produced a sentence containing an embedded Stroop task in each of two cognitive load conditions: congruent and incongruent. Three physiologic measures of autonomic arousal (pulse volume amplitude, pulse period, and skin conductance response amplitude) and four acoustic measures of voice (cepstral peak prominence, low-to-high spectral energy ratio, fundamental frequency, and sound pressure level) were analyzed in each cognitive load condition. Results. A logistic regression model was used to predict the cognitive load condition using participant as a categorical predictor and the four acoustic measures and three autonomic measures as continuous predictors. Skin conductance response amplitude and pulse volume amplitude were both predictive of cognitive load; however, no acoustic measures of voice were statistically significant predictors of cognitive load for older adults. Conclusions. These findings support the idea that increased cognitive load is associated with increased autonomic nervous system activity in older adults. The lack of changes in acoustic measures of voice with increased cognitive load may result from age-related changes in vocal quality and speech subsystems.},

  abstract = {Twelve patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease had acoustic speech analysis of sentence utterances to provide information on speech tempo and accuracy of articulation. As a measure of rate of speech the duration of opening-closing movements during articulation was determined from speech wave variables. The intensity of sound emission during articulatory closure as required for stop consonant production, for example, magnitude of p, magnitude of t, magnitude of k, was used as an index of the degree of closure. Speech tempo was not significantly different from normal. The patients, however, had a reduced capacity of completing articulatory occlusion. This was interpreted as reflecting a reduction in movement amplitude of the articulators. Articulatory “undershoot” was not uniform but influenced by linguistic demands in that the closures associated with a stressed syllable were performed at the expense of unstressed ones. Furthermore, switching between opening and closing movements of the articulators in sentence production seemed undisturbed. These results indicate that motor planning of speech differs from arm movement control.},

  abstract = {The various components of the central motor system are expected to play a similar role in speech production and in upper limb control. Slowed articulatory performance, therefore, must be expected in disorders of the corticobulbar tracts, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. Using an optoelectronic device, the present study recorded lower lip trajectories during production of sentence utterances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), cerebellar atrophy (CA), and pseudobulbar palsy (PB). The various subject groups showed a similar range of overall motor disability. Patients with CA and PB exhibited slowed movement execution in terms of a reduced ratio of peak velocity to maximum amplitude (“stiffness”). In contrast to upper limb motor control, the lip excursions showed an uncompromised shape of velocity profiles. Two different patterns emerged in HD. A single patient suffering from the akinetic-rigid Westphal variant of this disease had articulatory hypometria, whereas the remaining subjects showed significant bradykinesia under increased temporal demands, concomitant with normal movement amplitudes. The PD patients had unimpaired velocity-displacement relationships. Presumably, biomechanical constraints such as the rather small excursions of articulatory lower lip gestures or the scarce spindle supply of facial muscles account for the observed discrepancies between upper limb and speech motor control in PD.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Despite having distinct etiologies, acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) and childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) share the same central diagnostic challenge (i.e., isolating markers specific to an impairment in speech motor planning/programming). The purpose of this review was to evaluate and compare the state of the evidence on approaches to differential diagnosis for AOS and CAS and to identify gaps in each literature that could provide directions for future research aimed to improve clinical diagnosis of these disorders.                                         Method               We conducted a scoping review of literature published between 1997 and 2019, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. For both AOS and CAS, literature was charted and summarized around four main methodological approaches to diagnosis: speech symptoms, quantitative speech measures, impaired linguistic–motor processes, and neuroimaging.                                         Results               Results showed that similar methodological approaches have been used to study differential diagnosis of apraxia of speech in adults and children; however, the specific measures that have received the most research attention differ between AOS and CAS. Several promising candidate markers for AOS and CAS have been identified; however, few studies report metrics that can be used to assess their diagnostic accuracy.                                         Conclusions               Over the past two decades, there has been a proliferation of research identifying potential diagnostic markers of AOS and CAS. In order to improve clinical diagnosis of AOS and CAS, there is a need for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of multiple candidate markers, better control over language impairment comorbidity, more inclusion of speech-disordered control groups, and an increased focus on translational work moving toward clinical implementation of promising measures.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the presence and type of consonant distortions in speech of 79 French speakers with dysarthria due to Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA), and 26 control speakers. A total of 4990 consonants including selected occurrences of /d/, /g/, /t/, /k/ and /s/ in CV word-initial syllables, and /t/ in CV word medial and IP initial position were examined manually. Results show that the ALS group stands out with the more distorted consonants, while the PD and CA performed similarly. The distribution of the type of distortions differs also in the three dysarthric groups. While the most frequent type of distortion in ALS is incomplete closures of stops, devoicing of voiced consonant is the most frequent in the PD and CA groups. In the ALS group, distortions are also more uniformly distributed over consonant type and positions, while voiced consonants are more prone to distortion in PD and CA, as well as consonants in word medial position for PD. Finally, consonant distortions contribute strongly to perceived intelligibility and articulatory imprecision for the ALS and PD group.},

We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

There is little good-quality research evidence available on the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) of aided AAC use by those with PD. One of the main aims of this preliminary study, therefore, was to elicit the experiences and attitudes of speech and language therapists in this specific area of their practice as the basis for future efficacy research and clinical practice. Thirty speech and language therapists were questioned about their experience of introducing low- and high-tech AAC devices to this client-group. Of particular interest was the discovery of the factors identified by the therapists as influencing their introduction of aided AAC to someone with PD and affecting implementation and successful use. The factors reported were both disease-specific (e.g. motor problems) and more general factors (e.g. carer support) relevant to the process of introducing aided AAC to other adult client-groups. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. Some research questions are posed and the inclusion of people with PD and their carers in practice development is promoted.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for facemasks to protect against disease transmission. In response to shortages, many public health authorities have recommended homemade masks as acceptable alternatives to surgical masks and N95 respirators. Although mask wearing is intended, in part, to protect others from exhaled, virus-containing particles, few studies have examined particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air. Here, we measured outward emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing various expiratory activities while wearing different types of medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90\% and 74\% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average. In contrast, shedding of non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers in homemade cotton-fabric masks confounded explicit determination of their efficacy at reducing expiratory particle emission. Audio analysis of the speech and coughing intensity confirmed that people speak more loudly, but do not cough more loudly, when wearing a mask. Further work is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of medical-grade masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of homemade masks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally well known that speech perception is often improved with integrated audiovisual input whether in quiet or in noise. In many health-care environments, however, conventional surgical masks block visual access to the mouth and obscure other potential facial cues. In addition, these environments can be noisy. Although these masks may not alter the acoustic properties, the presence of noise in addition to the lack of visual input can have a deleterious effect on speech understanding. A transparent ("see-through") surgical mask may help to overcome this issue. PURPOSE: To compare the effect of noise and various visual input conditions on speech understanding for listeners with normal hearing (NH) and hearing impairment using different surgical masks. RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were assigned to one of three groups based on hearing sensitivity in this quasi-experimental, cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 31 adults participated in this study: one talker, ten listeners with NH, ten listeners with moderate sensorineural hearing loss, and ten listeners with severe-to-profound hearing loss. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Selected lists from the Connected Speech Test were digitally recorded with and without surgical masks and then presented to the listeners at 65 dB HL in five conditions against a background of four-talker babble (+10 dB SNR): without a mask (auditory only), without a mask (auditory and visual), with a transparent mask (auditory only), with a transparent mask (auditory and visual), and with a paper mask (auditory only). RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the spectral analyses of the speech stimuli with and without the masks; however, no more than ∼2 dB root mean square. Listeners with NH performed consistently well across all conditions. Both groups of listeners with hearing impairment benefitted from visual input from the transparent mask. The magnitude of improvement in speech perception in noise was greatest for the severe-to-profound group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm improved speech perception performance in noise for listeners with hearing impairment when visual input is provided using a transparent surgical mask. Most importantly, the use of the transparent mask did not negatively affect speech perception performance in noise.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic has created communication challenges for many individuals, particularly for those who are deaf or hard of hearing and for those who must speak through masks in suboptimal conditions. This study includes some newer mask options as well as transparent masks to help those who depend on lipreading and other facial cues. The results corroborate earlier published results for non-transparent masks, but transparent options have greater attenuation, resonant peaks, and deflect sounds in ways that nontransparent masks do not. Although transparent face coverings have poorer acoustic performance, the presence of visual cues remains important for both verbal and non-verbal communication. Fortunately, there are creative solutions and technologies available to overcome audio and/or visual barriers caused by face coverings.},

Most motor symptoms respond well to pharmacological and neurosurgical treatments, except some axial symptoms such as speech impairment, so-called dysarthria. However, speech therapy is rarely proposed to PD patients. This review aims at evaluating previous research on the effects of speech behavioral therapies in patients with PD. We also performed two meta-analyses focusing on speech loudness and voice pitch. We showed that intensive therapies in PD are the most effective for hypophonia and can lead to some improvement of voice pitch. Although speech therapy is effective in handling PD dysarthria, behavioral speech rehabilitation in PD still needs further validation.},

DESIGN: A prospective design was used for experiment 1, and a prospective, randomized cohort design was used for experiment 2. METHODS: The outlet ports of disposable anesthesia face masks were fitted with plastic caps with variable diameter drilled openings (9.6, 6.4, 3.2, and 1.6 mm) to create a series of mask openings. In experiment 1, P(sub) was measured in normophonic participants using the face mask during syllable repetitions in unoccluded and variable diameter opening conditions. In experiment 2, aerodynamic and acoustic measures were obtained in a group of dysphonic speakers before and after syllable and speech repetition tasks using the VOFM. RESULTS: In experiment 1, mean P(Sub) was observed to decrease while using the VOFM in all occlusion conditions versus nonocclusion, with a significant reduction in P(sub) observed between the baseline and the 6.4 mm condition. In experiment 2, standardized mean differences showed that many dysphonic participants produced reduced P(sub), increased airflow, and improved acoustic measures after the use of the VOFM in at least one occlusion condition. CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial changes in both aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of voice may be obtained in dysphonic speakers using a VOFM.

  abstract = {The language redundancy of a syllable, measured by its predictability given its context and inherent frequency, has been shown to have a strong inverse relationship with syllabic duration. This relationship is predicted by the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis, which proposes that robust communication in a noisy environment can be achieved with an inverse relationship between language redundancy and the predictability given acoustic observations (acoustic redundancy). A general version of the hypothesis predicts similar relationships between the spectral characteristics of speech and language redundancy. However, investigating this claim is hampered by difficulties in measuring the spectral characteristics of speech within large conversational corpora, and difficulties in forming models of acoustic redundancy based on these spectral characteristics. This paper addresses these difficulties by testing the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis with a very high-quality corpus collected for speech synthesis, and presents both durational and spectral data from vowel nuclei on a vowel-by-vowel basis. Results confirm the duration/ language redundancy results achieved in previous work, and show a significant relationship between language redundancy factors and the first two formants, although these results vary considerably by vowel. In general, however, vowels show increased centralization with increased language redundancy.},

This study aimed to assess the effect of using an N95 mask and face  shield on speech perception among healthcare workers with normal hearing. METHODS:  Twenty healthcare workers were recruited for the study. Pure tone audiometry was  conducted to ensure normal hearing. Speech reception threshold and speech  discrimination score were obtained, first without using personal protective  equipment and then repeated with the audiologist wearing an N95 mask and face  shield. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in speech reception threshold  (mean of 12.4 dB) and decrease in speech discrimination score (mean of 7 per cent)  was found while using the personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Use of personal  protective equipment significantly impairs speech perception. Alternate  communication strategies should be developed for effective communication.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Traditionally, deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders (MDs) is provided using stimulation frequencies equal to or above 100 Hz. However, recent evidence suggests that rela- tively low-frequency stimulation (LFS) below 100 Hz is an option to treat some patients with MDs. Objectives: We aimed to review the clinical and pathophysiological evidence supporting the use of stimulation frequencies below 100 Hz in different MDs. Results: Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus at 60 Hz has provided benefit in gait and other axial symptoms such as swallowing and speech. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus between 20 and 45 Hz can provide benefit in freezing of gait, cognition, and sleep quality in select patients with Par- kinson's disease. Stimulation of the globus pallidus internus below 100 Hz in patients with dystonia has provided benefit at the beginning of the therapy, although progressively higher stimulation frequencies seem to be necessary to maintain the clinical benefit. Relative LFS can lower energy requirements and reduce battery usageda useful feature, particularly in patients treated with high current energy. Conclusions: DBS at frequencies below 100 Hz is a therapeutic option in select cases of Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait and other axial symptoms, and in select patients with dystonia and other hyperkinetic movements, particularly those requiring an energy-saving strategy.},

The design of the HCRC Map Task enables us to do so. We examine two ‘tailoring’ changes in repeated mentions of landmark names: faster articulation and simplified referring expressions. Articulation results replicate Bard et al. (2000), depending only on what the speaker has heard. Change between mentions was no greater when it could be inferred that the listener could see the named item (Expt 1), and no less when the listener explicitly denied ability to do so (Expt 2). Word duration fell for speakerGiven listener-New items (Expt 3). Reduction was unaffected by the repeater’s ability to see the mentioned landmark (Expt 4). In contrast, referential form was more sensitive to both listener- (Expt 3) and speakerknowledge (Expt 4). The results conform most closely to a Dual Process model: fast, automatic, processes let the speaker-knowledge prime word articulation, while costly assessments of listener-knowledge influence only referential form.},

As manual segmentation is a lengthy and tedious task, automatic procedures have been developed over the years. They rely on acoustic Hidden Markov Models. Many studies have been conducted, and refinements developed for corpus based speech synthesis, where the technology is mainly used in a speaker-dependent context and applied on good quality speech signals. In a different research direction, automatic speech-text alignment is also used for phonetic and linguistic studies on large speech corpora. In this case, speaker independent acoustic models are mandatory, and the speech quality may not be so good. The speech models rely on 10 ms shift between acoustic frames, and their topology leads to strong minimum duration constraints. This paper focuses on the acoustic analysis frame rate, and gives a first insight on the impact of the frame rate on corpus-based phonetic studies.},

The clothing has been found to impose not only a thermal burden but also a mechanical burden. Respirators restrict the visual field and affect speech intelligibility. Body movements are limited by the clothing; manual dexterity capabilities and psychomotor performance can also be negatively impacted. In addition, wearing the clothing may induce psychological stress. Symptoms include breathing distress, tremors, and claustrophobia. Efforts described here are underway to address performance issues during development of new protective uniforms. Research needed to address psychological issues is also suggested.},

Dysarthria is a pervasive symptom of Friedreich's ataxia, yet the clinical presentation of speech symptoms remains poorly understood, leaving clinicians without the evidence required to develop therapy interventions. The research reported herein had three aims: the first was to document the severity of the intelligibility deficit associated with Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria; the second was to document the phonetic profile of the intelligibility deficit; and the third was to use the results of the phonetic profile to estimate the motor control mechanisms and neurological substrates implicated in Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria. Eleven adult males with Friedreich's ataxia were recruited. Intelligibility was assessed using a single-word multiple-choice task completed by ten listeners. Intelligibility severity ratings ranged from mild to severe. The majority of subjects fell into the mild category. The phonetic errors revealed a distinctive profile, with word-final plosive voicing contrast representing the highest source of error. Involvement of cerebro-cerebellar loops was considered to be compatible with the profile results. Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria has a distinctive phonetic profile and contains subgroups of different severity. High sources of error identified in the phonetic profile should be considered when developing targets for therapy intervention. Neurological substrates are considered to vary across individuals and to include involvement of cerebro-cerebellar loops. Further research involving acoustic analysis of final plosive voicing contrasts would provide further insights into the neurological substrates involved.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor operations, cognitive tasks and affective processes. Here, we revisit the concept of the cerebellar syndrome in the light of recent advances in our understanding of cerebellar operations. The key symptoms and signs of cerebellar dysfunction, often grouped under the generic term of ataxia, are discussed. Vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance are associated with lesions of the vestibulo-cerebellar, vestibulo-spinal, or cerebellar ocular motor systems. The cerebellum plays a major role in the online to long-term control of eye movements (control of calibration, reduction of eye instability, maintenance of ocular alignment). Ocular instability, nystagmus, saccadic intrusions, impaired smooth pursuit, impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and ocular misalignment are at the core of oculomotor cerebellar deficits. As a motor speech disorder, ataxic dysarthria is highly suggestive of cerebellar pathology. Regarding motor control of limbs, hypotonia, a- or dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria, grasping deficits and various tremor phenomenologies are observed in cerebellar disorders to varying degrees. There is clear evidence that the cerebellum participates in force perception and proprioceptive sense during active movements. Gait is staggering with a wide base, and tandem gait is very often impaired in cerebellar disorders. In terms of cognitive and affective operations, impairments are found in executive functions, visual-spatial processing, linguistic function, and affective regulation (Schmahmann's syndrome). Nonmotor linguistic deficits including disruption of articulatory and graphomotor planning, language dynamics, verbal fluency, phonological, and semantic word retrieval, expressive and receptive syntax, and various aspects of reading and writing may be impaired after cerebellar damage. The cerebellum is organized into (a) a primary sensorimotor region in the anterior lobe and adjacent part of lobule VI, (b) a second sensorimotor region in lobule VIII, and (c) cognitive and limbic regions located in the posterior lobe (lobule VI, lobule VIIA which includes crus I and crus II, and lobule VIIB). The limbic cerebellum is mainly represented in the posterior vermis. The cortico-ponto-cerebellar and cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops establish close functional connections between the cerebellum and the supratentorial motor, paralimbic and association cortices, and cerebellar symptoms are associated with a disruption of these loops.},

Method: Speech samples and communicative participation scores were collected from individuals with dysarthria (n = 32). Speech was analyzed for two acoustic metrics (i.e., articulatory precision and speech rate), and an objective measure of intelligibility was generated from listener transcripts. Mediation analysis was used to evaluate pathways of effect between acoustics, intelligibility, and communicative participation. Results: We observed a strong relationship between articulatory precision and intelligibility and a moderate relationship between intelligibility and communicative participation. Collectively, data supported a significant relationship between articulatory precision and communicative participation, which was almost entirely mediated through intelligibility. These relationships were not significant when speech rate was specified as the acoustic variable of interest. Conclusion: The statistical corroboration of our causal instantiation of the ICF framework with articulatory acoustics affords important support toward the development of a comprehensive causal framework to understand and, ultimately, address restricted communicative participation in dysarthria.},

To simulate realistic classroom conditions, speech stimuli were  presented in the presence of speech-shaped noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of  +3\,dB under two different reverberation times (0.4\,s and 3.1\,s). The use of fabric  masks yielded a significantly greater reduction in SI compared to the other masks.  Therefore, surgical masks or N95 masks are recommended in teaching environments.},

A discriminant analysis was used to differentiate speech and non-speech parameters between groups. Regularity of DDK was specifically impaired in SCA3, whereas impairments of speech parameters, i.e., rate and modulation were stronger affected in SCA6. Speech parameters are particularly vulnerable in SCA6, while non-speech oral motor features are notably impaired in SCA3.},

  abstract = {Identifying speech requires that listeners make rapid use of fine-grained acoustic cues—a process that is facilitated by being able to see the talker’s face. Face masks present a challenge to this process because they can both alter acoustic information and conceal the talker’s mouth. Here, we investigated the degree to which different types of face masks and noise levels affect speech intelligibility and subjective listening effort for young (N\,=\,180) and older (N\,=\,180) adult listeners. We found that in quiet, mask type had little influence on speech intelligibility relative to speech produced without a mask for both young and older adults. However, with the addition of moderate (−\,5~dB SNR) and high (−\,9~dB SNR) levels of background noise, intelligibility dropped substantially for all types of face masks in both age groups. Across noise levels, transparent face masks and cloth face masks with filters impaired performance the most, and surgical face masks had the smallest influence on intelligibility. Participants also rated speech produced with a face mask as more effortful than unmasked speech, particularly in background noise. Although young and older adults were similarly affected by face masks and noise in terms of intelligibility and subjective listening effort, older adults showed poorer intelligibility overall and rated the speech as more effortful to process relative to young adults. This research will help individuals make more informed decisions about which types of masks to wear in various communicative settings.},

  abstract = {In psychology, attempts to replicate published findings are less successful than expected. For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

An intelligibility test designed by Kent, Weismer, Kent, and Rosenbek (1989a) groups target and error words in minimal-pair contrasts. This format allows for construction of phonetic error profiles based on listener responses, thus allowing for a direct comparison of the acoustic characteristics of vowels perceived as the intended target with those heard as something other than the target. The high-low vowel contrast was found to be a consistent error across clinical groups and therefore was selected for acoustic analysis. The contrast was expected to have well-defined acoustic measures or correlates, derived from the literature, that directly relate to a listeners' responses for that token. These measures include the difference between the second and first formant frequency (F2-F1), the difference between F1 and the fundamental frequency (FO), and vowel duration. Results showed that the acoustic characteristics of tongue-height errors were not clearly differentiated from the acoustic characteristics of targets. Rather, the acoustic characteristics of errors often looked like noisy (nonprototypical) versions of the targets. Results are discussed in terms of the test from which the errors were derived and within the framework of speech perception theory.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the importance of fundamental frequency (F0) as a perceptual cue for identification of vowel targets produced by speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been suggested in the literature that F0 is a redundant cue for vowel identification in highly intelligible speech. For speakers with dysarthria who are having difficulty with segmental and suprasegmental aspects of production which result in ambiguous or conflicting cues in the acoustic signal, F0 may have increased perceptual importance for accurate identification of vowel targets. In the present study, F0 contours for single-word targets produced in sentence level material by 20 speakers with PD and 20 control speakers were synthetically modified in several different ways (i.e., flattened and enhanced). Listener identification of vowel targets across the F0 conditions was recorded. The accuracy of vowel identification for the control group was not affected by the flattening of the F0 contour. For the speakers with PD, however, modification of the F0 contour (flattening or enhancing) affected the accuracy with which listeners identified certain vowels. Differences in vowel identification were found primarily for the front vowels /I, epsilon, ae/ along a high-low continuum.},

The relevancy of nonspeech oral motor behaviors to speech motor performance in assessment and treatment is challenged on several grounds. First, contemporary motor theory suggests that movement control is task specific. In other words, it is tied to the unique goals, sources of information, and characteristics of varying motor acts. Documented differences in movement characteristics for speech production versus nonspeech oral motor tasks support this claim. Second, advantages of training nonspeech oral motor tasks versus training speech production are not supported by current principles of motor learning and neural plasticity. Empirical data supports experience-specific training. Finally, functional imaging studies document differences in activation patterns for speech compared with nonspeech oral motor tasks in neurologically healthy individuals.}

  abstract = {This paper looks at the perception of prosodic prominence and the interpretation of focus position in the unrelated languages, Samoan and English. In many languages, prosodic prominence is a key marker of focus, so it is expected that prosodic prominence would affect judgments of focus position. However, it is shown that focus position, in turn, influences the perception of prosodic prominence according to language-specific expectations about the alignment between focus position and nuclear accent placement. Two sets of parallel perception experiments in Samoan and English are reported. In the first, participants judged the most prosodically prominent word in sentences which varied in syntactic construction (cleft/canonical) and intended stress position (subject/object). In both languages, participants were more likely to choose the intended stressed word if it was in the focus position. However, this effect was much larger in Samoan, which fits with its relatively lower functionality of prosodic prominence. In the second experiment, participants were asked to choose which question had been asked, consistent with subject or object focus. It was found that in both languages, participants weighted syntactic and prosodic cues to focus in line with expectations from their language. These findings have implications for how we conceive the role of prosodic prominence in speech processing across languages.},

I claim that METRICAL STRUCTURE plays a central role (Ladd 2008, Truckenbrodt 1995).Information structure (defined as in Steedman 1991 and Vallduvi \& Vilkuna 1998) places strong constraints on the PROBABILISTIC mapping of words onto metrical prosodie structure—that is, foci usually align with nuclear accents and theme/rheme units with prosodie phrases, and themes are less metrically prominent than rhemes. It is shown that focus position, scope, and pragmatic interpretation are then derived by manipulating EXPECTED PROMINENCE within metrical structure. Broadly, the more prominent a word than expected, the more likely a contrastive reading; the less prominent, the more likely a givenness reading. Both constructed and naturally occurring examples from the Switchboard corpus are used.}

Face protections are mostly used in order to stop the air aerosol coming out of our mouths. Nevertheless, this fact may also have a negative effect on speech transmission both in outdoor and indoor spaces. After a severe lockdown, classes have now started again. The adoption of face protection by teachers is either recommended or mandatory even though this is affecting speech intelligibility and thus students’ comprehension. This study aims to understand how protections may affect the speech transmission in classrooms and how this could be influenced by the several typologies of face protections. An experimental campaign was conducted in a classroom in two different reverberant conditions, measuring and comparing the variation in speech transmission and sound pressure level at different receiver positions. Furthermore, a microphone array was used to investigate the distribution of the indoor sound field, depending on the sound source. Results clearly show how different types of personal protection equipment do affect speech transmission and sound pressure level especially at mid-high frequency and that the source emission lobes vary when wearing certain types of personal devices.},

Respirator wear conditions included the use of one unmodified and three mechanical speech diaphragms modified to reduce the surface area of the vibrating inner membrane available for sound transmission. Average MRT scores decreased linearly as background noise levels increased for all conditions. Lower MRT scores were observed for all respirator speech diaphragm conditions compared to the nonrespirator condition within each noise category. Average MRT scores differed significantly between the unmodified speech diaphragm and one with a 70\% reduced surface area with a 40-dBA background noise. However, MRT scores were similar between the modified and unmodified diaphragms at both the 60- and 80-dBA noise levels.

Co-registered articulatory data (degree of nasalization, tongue height, breathiness) and acoustic data (F1 frequency) related to the productions of phonemic oral and nasal vowels of Southern French were first collected from four native speakers, and the acoustic recordings were subsequently presented to nine Australian English naïve listeners, who were instructed to imitate the native productions. During these imitations, similar articulatory and acoustic data were collected in order to compare the articulatory strategies used by the two groups. The results suggest that the imitators successfully reproduced the acoustic distinctions made by the native speakers, but that they did so using different articulatory strategies. The articulatory strategies for the vowel pair /ɑ̃/-/a/ suggest that listeners (at least partially) misperceived F1-lowering due to nasalization and breathiness as being due to tongue height. Additional evidence supports perceptual cue re-weighting, in that the naïve imitators employed nasalance less, and tongue height more, in order to obtain the same F1 nasal-oral distinctions that the native speakers had originally produced.},

  abstract = {Methods. Forty-two individuals with diagnosis of idiopathic PD of both genders were recruited in the study. Mean and peak SGP, spirometric indices, maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and peak cough flow (PCF) during reflex and voluntary cough were measured on all participants. Results. The analysis revealed that peak SGP had a moderate but significant linear association with MEP (r = 0.38; P = 0.013), voluntary (r = 0.31; P = 0.051), and reflex PCF (r = 0.40; P = 0.012), but not with maximum inspiratory pressure (r = 0.23; P = 0.145). Higher values in peak SGP were associated with higher values in MEP, voluntary PCF, and reflex PCF. No linear association was detected between peak SGP and spirometric indices. Conclusions. Peak SGP has a direct association with voluntary and reflex PCF, and expiratory muscle strength, but not with inspiratory muscle strength. The association with peak SGP is higher for reflex PCF than for voluntary PCF.},

The instrumental  measurements of acoustic parameters were limited during the COVID-19 pandemic by the  common belief that a face mask affects the results of the analysis. The purpose of  our study was to investigate the impact of surgical masks on F0, jitter, shimmer and  harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in adults. METHODS: The study was carried out on a  selected group of 50 healthy subjects. Voice samples were recorded directly in  Praat. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a  conversational voice intensity, with no intensity or frequency variation, for the  Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the  surgical mask. RESULTS: None of the variations in acoustic voice analysis detected  wearing a surgical mask and not wearing a surgical mask were statistically  significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the acoustic voice analysis  procedure can continue to be performed with the use of a surgical mask for the  patient, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In response to the urgent need for safe aircrew respiratory protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic, three small descriptive evaluations were conducted with aircrew and air traffic controllers (ATC) that assessed the impact of mask use on safety and performance onboard rotary wing aircraft.METHODS: A series of evaluations assessed aircrew performance using the 3M(TM) Model 1860 N95 respiratory protection mask, two aviation-specific cloth mask prototypes, and a commercial off-the-shelf aviation-specific cloth mask. The series of evaluations included different sets of subjects consisting of up to five Black Hawk helicopter aircrew members, air traffic control (ATC), and 12 CH-47 aircrew members. The Modified Rhyme Test was used to measure speech intelligibility and was administered in the UH-60 among crewmembers of the same aircraft, between pilots of different aircraft, and between the pilots and ATC. Measures of workload, usability, comfort, and pulse oximetry were also administered.RESULTS: Results from the Modified Rhyme Test indicated that all subjects scored greater than 80\% accuracy given the proper microphone positioning relative to the mask. With respect to workload, NASA-TLX total scores for the perform radio communications task was 50.83.DISCUSSION: Despite an elevated perceived degree of workload on the communications flight task, results from the speech intelligibility test indicated that performance was maintained within the acceptable range as defined by MIL-STD-1474E, Design Criteria Standard Noise Limit. This abbreviated evaluation suggests that the face masks tested are safe for use by helicopter aircrew under the conditions tested.Cave KM, Kelley AM, Feltman KA, Gerstner JA, Stewart JL, Crowley JS.

There are a number of proposed ways to quantify vowel production clinically, including vowel space area, formant centralization ratio, and vowel articulation index (VAI). The stability, reliability, and sensitivity of three VS measurements were investigated in two experiments. Stability was explored across three inter-recording intervals and challenged in two sensitivity conditions. Data suggest that VAI is the most stable measure across 30 s, 2 h, and 4 h inter-recording intervals. VAI appears the most sensitive metric of the three measures in conditions of fatigue and noise. These analyses highlight the need for stability and sensitivity analysis when developing and validating acoustic metrics, and underscore the potential of the VAI for vowel analysis.},

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) substantially relieves motor symptoms in advanced-stage patients for whom medication produces disabling dyskinesias. This study investigated speech changes as a result of DBS settings chosen to maximize motor performance. The speech of 10 PD patients and 12 normal controls was analyzed for syllable rate and variability, syllable length patterning, vowel fraction, voice-onset time variability, and spirantization. These were normalized by the controls' standard deviation to represent distance from normal and combined into a composite measure. Results show that DBS settings relieving motor symptoms can improve speech, making it up to three standard deviations closer to normal. However, the clinically motivated settings evaluated here show greater capacity to impair, rather than improve, speech. A feedback device developed from these findings could be useful to clinicians adjusting DBS parameters, as a means for ensuring they do not unwittingly choose DBS settings which impair patients' communication.},

  abstract = {Seeing a person's mouth move for [ga] while hearing [ba] often results in the perception of "da." Such audiovisual integration of speech cues, known as the McGurk effect, is stable within but variable across individuals. When the visual or auditory cues are degraded, due to signal distortion or the perceiver's sensory impairment, reliance on cues via the impoverished modality decreases. This study tested whether cue-reliance adjustments due to exposure to reduced cue availability are persistent and transfer to subsequent perception of speech with all cues fully available. A McGurk experiment was administered at the beginning and after a month of mandatory face-mask wearing (enforced in Czechia during the 2020 pandemic). Responses to audio-visually incongruent stimuli were analyzed from 292 persons (ages 16-55), representing a cross-sectional sample, and 41 students (ages 19-27), representing a longitudinal sample. The extent to which the participants relied exclusively on visual cues was affected by testing time in interaction with age. After a month of reduced access to lipreading, reliance on visual cues (present at test) somewhat lowered for younger and increased for older persons. This implies that adults adapt their speech perception faculty to an altered environmental availability of multimodal cues, and that younger adults do so more efficiently. This finding demonstrates that besides sensory impairment or signal noise, which reduce cue availability and thus affect audio-visual cue reliance, having experienced a change in environmental conditions can modulate the perceiver's (otherwise relatively stable) general bias towards different modalities during speech communication.},

The between language variation is also largely (but not entirely) predictable by assuming that languages choose one of the three possibilities for the degree of aspiration of voiceless stops. Some languages, however, have VOTs that are markedly different from the generally observed values. The phonetic output of a grammar has to contain language specific components to account for these results.},

  abstract = {In this special collection entitled Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the World's Languages, we have compiled eleven studies investigating the voicing contrast in 19 languages. The collection provides extensive data obtained from 270 speakers across those languages, examining VOT and other acoustic, aerodynamic and articulatory measures. The languages studied may be divided into four groups: `aspirating' languages with a two-way contrast (English, three varieties of German); `true voicing' languages with a two-way contrast (Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, two Iranian languages Pashto and Wakhi); languages with a three-way contrast (Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Yerevan Armenia, three Indo-Aryan languages, Dawoodi, Punjabi and Shina, and Burushaki spoken in India); and Indo-Aryan languages with a more than three-way contrast (Jangli and Urdu with a four-way contrast, and Sindhi and Siraiki with a five-way contrast). We discuss the cross-linguistic data, focusing on how much VOT alone tells us about the voicing contrast in these languages, and what other phonetic dimensions (such as consonant-induced F0 and voice quality) are needed for a complete understanding of laryngeal contrast in these languages. Implications for various issues emerge: universal phonetic feature systems, effects of language contact on linguistic levelling, and the relation between laryngeal contrast and supralaryngeal articulation. The cross-linguistic VOT data also lead us to discuss how the distribution of VOT as measured acoustically may allow us to infer the underlying articulation and how it might be approached in gestural phonologies. The discussion on these multiple issues sparks new questions to be resolved, and provide indications of where the field may be best directed in exploring laryngeal contrast in voicing in the world's languages.},

  abstract = {The influence of information structure (IS: givenness, accessibility, newness and focus) on pitch accent assignment and acoustic prominence measures of prenuclear words was investigated for American English speech elicited through read production of mini-stories. Results showed a consistent pattern of accenting the initial content word in the sentence, supporting an analysis of prenuclear accent as structural, or ‘rhythmic’. While no association was observed between IS and accent type (e.g., H*, L*, L+H*, L*+H), the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence was modulated by information structure. In particular, words that carry contrastive focus generally showed more extreme f0 excursions relative to the average. In addition, there was a strong influence of speaking style or ‘affect’ on both pitch accent type and the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence. Speakers were more likely to produce L+H* accents in a lively than a neutral speaking style. Differences in affect were also strongly reflected in f0 excursion, duration, and amplitude within the target word. Overall, this study indicates both linguistic (information structure) and paralinguistic (affect) influences on the phonetic implementation of prenuclear prominence, with varying influence of these two factors on the phonological assignment of prenuclear pitch accents.},

Early accounts claim that discourse-new or focused words receive a prominence-lending high/rising pitch accent, while given words are unaccented, with reduced prominence. Empirical findings are varied, but paint a more complex picture of the prosodic encoding of information structure. The present study investigated the phonological and phonetic encoding of information status and contrastive focus in nuclear position in American English, from speech read under neutral and lively affect. Given information was associated with decreased phonological and phonetic prominence, contrastive information with enhanced prominence, while new information corresponded to increased phonological, but not phonetic prominence, as assessed in pitch accent type, duration, intensity, and voice quality. The findings indicate a probabilistic relationship between information structure and nuclear pitch accent type, and gradient expression of information structure in acoustic prominence.},

Target consonants are analyzed from utterance (U) or Intonational Phrase (IP)-initial position, U/IP-final position, and U/IP-medial position, with and without contrastive focal accent. VOT and F0 at the onset of the following vowel are measured as the main acoustic correlates of voicing in English from the speech of six male American English speakers. The statistical results indicate that the accentual effect is greater and more consistent than the boundary effect on acoustic patterns. The distribution of acoustic measures also shows a greater distinction between the two contrastive stops when accented. Positional variation is not very distinctive, and the enhanced contrast marking in domain-initial position predicted from articulatory studies is not observed in the present setting.},

Routes of transmission differ, but the respiratory droplet or airborne route has the greatest potential to disrupt social intercourse, while being amenable to prevention by the humble face mask. Different types of masks give different levels of protection to the user. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has even resulted in a global shortage of face masks and the raw materials that go into them, driving individuals to self-produce masks from household items. At the same time, research has been accelerated towards improving the quality and performance of face masks, e.g., by introducing properties such as antimicrobial activity and superhydrophobicity. This review will cover mask-wearing from the public health perspective, the technical details of commercial and home-made masks, and recent advances in mask engineering, disinfection, and materials and discuss the sustainability of mask-wearing and mask production into the future.},

  abstract = {Substantial empirical research has revealed that temporal and spectral phonetic vowel reduction occurs in “easy” processing contexts relative to “hard” processing contexts, including effects of lexical frequency, lexical neighborhood density, semantic predictability, discourse mention, and speaking style. Theoretical accounts of this phonetic reduction process include listener-oriented approaches, in which the reduction reflects the talker’s balancing the comprehension needs of the listener with production effort constraints, talker-oriented approaches, in which reduction is argued to result entirely from constraints on speech production processes, and evolutionary approaches, in which reduction results directly from long-term interactive communication within a community. Recent research in our laboratory has revealed complex interactions among the linguistic, social, and cognitive factors involved in phonetic vowel reduction processes. These interactions reveal variation in the robustness of phonetic reduction effects across linguistic factors, as well as different patterns of interactions among linguistic, social, and cognitive factors across acoustic domains. These interactions challenge aspects of each of the three existing models of phonetic reduction. We therefore propose that a more complex view of the relationship between processing demands and phonetic vowel reduction processes is necessary to account for these observed patterns of variation.},

  abstract = {Much of what is known about prosody is based on native speaker intuitions of idealized speech, or on prosodic annotations from trained annotators whose auditory impressions are augmented by visual evidence from speech waveforms, spectrograms and pitch tracks. Expanding the prosodic data currently available to cover more languages, and to cover a broader range of unscripted speech styles, is prohibitive due to the time, money and human expertise needed for prosodic annotation. We describe an alternative approach to prosodic data collection, with coarse-grained annotations from a cohort of untrained annotators performing rapid prosody transcription (RPT) using LMEDS, an open-source software tool we developed to enable large-scale, crowd-sourced data collection with RPT. Results from three RPT experiments are reported. The reliability of RPT is analysed comparing kappa statistics for lab-based and crowd-sourced annotations for American English, comparing annotators from the same (US) versus different (Indian) dialect groups, and comparing each RPT annotator with a ToBI annotation. Results show better reliability for same-dialect annotators (US), and the best overall reliability from crowd-sourced US annotators, though lab-based annotations are the most similar to ToBI annotations. A generalized additive mixed model is used to test differences among annotator groups in the factors that predict prosodic annotation. Results show that a common set of acoustic and contextual factors predict prosodic labels for all annotator groups, with only small differences among the RPT groups, but with larger effects on prosodic marking for ToBI annotators. The findings suggest methods for optimizing the efficiency of RPT annotations. Overall, crowd-sourced prosodic annotation is shown to be efficient, and to rely on established cues to prosody, supporting its use for prosody research across languages, dialects, speaker populations, and speech genres.},

  abstract = {This study tests the influence of acoustic cues and non-acoustic contextual factors on listeners’ perception of prominence in three languages whose prominence systems differ in the phonological patterning of prominence and in the association of prominence with information structure—English, French and Spanish. Native speakers of each language performed an auditory rating task to mark prominent words in samples of conversational speech under two instructions: with prominence defined in terms of acoustic or meaning-related criteria. Logistic regression models tested the role of task instruction, acoustic cues and non-acoustic contextual factors in predicting binary prominence ratings of individual listeners. In all three languages we find similar effects of prosodic phrase structure and acoustic cues (F0, intensity, phone-rate) on prominence ratings, and differences in the effect of word frequency and instruction. In English, where phrasal prominence is used to convey meaning related to information structure, acoustic and meaning criteria converge on very similar prominence ratings. In French and Spanish, where prominence plays a lesser role in signaling information structure, phrasal prominence is perceived more narrowly on structural and acoustic grounds. Prominence ratings from untrained listeners correspond with ToBI pitch accent labels for each language. Distinctions in ToBI pitch accent status (nuclear, prenuclear, unaccented) are reflected in empirical and model-predicted prominence ratings. In addition, words with a ToBI pitch accent type that is typically associated with contrastive focus are more likely to be rated as prominent in Spanish and English, but no such effect is found for French. These findings are discussed in relation to probabilistic models of prominence production and perception.},

  abstract = {The perception of prosodic prominence in spontaneous speech is investigated through an online task of prosody transcription using untrained listeners. Prominence is indexed through a probabilistic prominence score assigned to each word based on the proportion of transcribers who perceived the word as prominent. Correlation and regression analyses between perceived prominence, acoustic measures and measures of a word’s information status are conducted to test three hypotheses: (i) prominence perception is signal-driven, influenced by acoustic factors reflecting speakers’ productions; (ii) perception is expectation-driven, influenced by the listener’s prior experience of word frequency and repetition; (iii) any observed influence of word frequency on perceived prominence is mediated through the acoustic signal. Results show correlates of perceived prominence in acoustic measures, in word log-frequency and in the repetition index of a word, consistent with both signal-driven and expectation-driven hypotheses of prominence perception. But the acoustic correlates of perceived prominence differ somewhat from the correlates of word frequency, suggesting an independent effect of frequency on prominence perception. A speech processing account is offered as a model of s­ignal-driven and expectation-driven effects on prominence perception, where prominence ratings are a function of the ease of lexical processing, as measured through the activation levels of lexical and sub-lexical units.},

This study investigated whether the use of such facemasks would affect respiratory behavior in terms of lung volume (excursion, at initiation and at termination) or duration (of inspiration and of expiration) during speech or singing. METHOD: The respiratory patterns of 6 females were recorded using uniaxial surface magnetometry during 4 tasks: quiet breathing, a /pa/ syllabic train, reading ("The Rainbow Passage"), and singing a Christmas carol ("Silent night"). Each task was performed in 4 facemask conditions: wearing no facemask, wearing a facemask rim only, wearing a standard respiratory facemask, and wearing a vented pneumotachograph facemask. RESULTS: No significant effect was found for any of the facemask conditions on lung volume or duration measures during any tasks. CONCLUSION: The results confirm earlier studies that the vented pneumotachograph facemask does not affect breathing behavior in speech research studies and extends the finding to the study of breathing behavior in singing and to the use of a standard respiratory facemask.},

The present study of upper lip, lower lip, and jaw movements during speech in PD was thus aimed at determining whether (1) PD speech kinematic deficits are comparable to those often observed in simpler limb movements; (2) coordination for multimovement actions such as speech is aberrant in PD, as recently claimed; and (3) the component muscle groups involved in this behaviour manifest uniform deficits. Results indicated that despite reduced amplitudes of jaw and upper lip displacement in PD subjects, all three of these oral movements were of normal duration. Secondly, PD lower lip movements manifested no deficits and bradykinesia (reduced velocity) was only found in movements of the jaw. Finally, there was an indication of movement coordination aberrations in these parkinsonian subjects. Overall, these results not only suggest a difference between orofacial and limb movement impairments in PD, but also document the need to broaden our perspectives on this movement disorder by examining a wider range of functional motor tasks.},

This study investigated the performance degradation of speech intelligibility in low-level noise for different speaker-listener distances and message sets (single words or predictable sentences) that occurred while wearing a respirator compared with not wearing a respirator. Thirteen speaker-listener pairs with normal hearing and speech were used. Speaker-listener separation distances were 0.61, 1.22, 1.83, 2.44, 3.05, and 3.66 m (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ft) for the respirator condition and 1.22, 2.44: 3.05, 6.1, 9.15, and 12.2 m (4, 8, 10, 20, 30, and 40 ft) for the no-respirator condition, The means of the scores were used to determine the speech performance rating for both the single-word and sentence comprehension tests. The performance rating expresses the percentage of performance that can be expected while wearing a respirator compared with not wearing a respirator. Scores were interpolated linearly at distances at which no data were obtained. As expected, the speech performance rating was higher for the sentence comprehension test than for the single-word comprehension test at each distance. At a distance of 12.2 m, the speech performance rating for the sentence comprehension was 70\%, For the single-word comprehension test, the speech performance rating was zero for distances greater than 9.1 m.},

The study included 8 speakers with ataxic dysarthria (AD), 16 speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) as a result of Parkinson's disease, and 24 unimpaired control participants. Each participant performed a series of sentence repetitions under habitual, fast, and slow speaking rate conditions. An algorithm to measure utterance-to-utterance spectro-temporal variation (UUV; Cummins, 2009) was used. Speech rate and intelligibility were also measured. UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the AD but not the HD groups, presumably because of differences in intelligibility in the samples used and not because of differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared with habitual and fast speaking rates. UUV results were consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way. The results suggest that the UUV could be developed into an easy-to-use clinical tool that could function as a valid and reliable assessment and outcome measure.},

  abstract = {Along the normal aging process, voice tends to become weak, breathy, and loses projection, which may interfere in the communication process. One reliable way to evaluate voice quality is through acoustical analysis using, for instance, the long-term average spectrum (LTAS). The aim of this study was to identify acoustic measures, particularly LTAS’s, which characterize vocal aging in women without vocal complaints. For this purpose, 30 elderly and 30 young women were included in this study. All spoke standard Portuguese and none had a history of vocal and laryngeal alterations or respiratory diseases. On the basis of the reading task, in habitual and loud levels, the following parameters were assessed: the equivalent sound level (Leq), the speaking fundamental frequency (SFF) and, at the LTAS window, the difference between the levels of the regions of the first formant and fundamental frequency F0 (L1 À L0), alpha ratio, and the amplitude levels obtained at equal intervals of 160 Hz, ranging from 0 to 8 kHz. There were significant differences between young and old voices for SFF and Leq in both levels. In the LTAS window, amplitude levels were higher for young voices, comprising all frequencies except those in the regions between 4.6–6.7 and 4.8–6.5 kHz, in habitual and loud levels, respectively. There were also significant differences regarding L1 À L0 and alpha ratio between groups, in both levels.The observed differences in LTAS’s slopes, L1 À L0 measures, and even Leq and SFF measures, may be attributed, to some extent, to lower subglottal pressure or a glottal setting providing a slower glottal closing speed for the elderly group.},

Ten patients with idiopathic PD were included. All patients were studied in practically defined on- and off-phases. They were asked to perform isometric tongue protrusions, which were registered by means of a calibrated tocograph. Results of on- and off-conditions were compared using non-parametric tests. Maximum force and contraction duration did not differ significantly between both conditions, but the integrated measurement of both (area under curve) was significantly larger in the on-state. The force decay slope was significantly lower in the on-state. No correlations were found with disease severity, disease stage or age. These findings fit the known pathophysiological effects on patterns of isometric muscle contraction in PD. It remains to be demonstrated if the effects of levodopa on tongue strength and endurance correlate with alterations in speech intelligibility, articulation and respiration.},

A comparison of the results of previous studies on speech rate in PD is hampered by methodological differences. In this study, we evaluated the effects of levodopa on speech rate and on its variability in a standardized reading task. Twenty-five patients were studied before and after levodopa administration while reading a standardized text. In accordance with previous studies, no significant improvement of speech rate was found. Rather an increased variability of speech rate in the on-medication state could be demonstrated. It is possible that this increased variability may be the consequence of respiratory deficits due to levodopa-induced dyskinesia or an increase of dysfluencies. However, the effects of defective auditory feedback and disturbed executive function cannot be ruled out.},

To evaluate, in the ataxic dysarthria, the relationship between the vowel space area (VSA), the formant centralization ratio (FCR) and the mean of the primary distances with the speech intelligibility. A sample of fourteen Spanish speakers, ten with dysarthria and four controls, was used. The values of first and second formants in 140 vowels extracted of 140 words were analyzed. To calculate the level of intelligibility seven listeners were involved and a task of identification verbal stimuli was used. The dysarthric subjects have less contrast between middle and high vowels and between back vowels. Significant differences in the VSA, FCR and mean of the primary distances compared to control subjects (p = 0.007, 0.005 and 0.030, respectively) are observed. Regression analysis show the relationship between VSA and the mean of primary distances with the level of speech intelligibility (r = 0.60 and 0.74, respectively). Ataxic dysarthria subjects have lower contrast and vowel centralization in carrying out the vowels. The acoustic measures studied in this preliminary work have a high sensitivity in the detection of dysarthria but only the VSA and the mean of primary distances provide information on the severity of this type of speech disturbance.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) or posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) consists of a constellation of neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological and neurogenic speech and language deficits. It is most commonly observed in children after posterior fossa tumor surgery. The most prominent feature of CMS is mutism, which generally starts after a few days after the operation, has a limited duration and is typically followed by motor speech deficits. However, the core speech disorder subserving CMS is still unclear. This study investigates the speech and language symptoms following posterior fossa medulloblastoma surgery in a 12-year-old right-handed boy. An extensive battery of formal speech (DIAS = Diagnostic Instrument Apraxia of Speech) and language tests were administered during a follow-up of 6 weeks after surgery. Although the neurological and neuropsychological (affective, cognitive) symptoms of this patient are consistent with Schmahmann's syndrome, the speech and language symptoms were markedly different from what is typically described in the literature. In-depth analyses of speech production revealed features consistent with a diagnosis of apraxia of speech (AoS) while ataxic dysarthria was completely absent. In addition, language assessments showed genuine aphasic deficits as reflected by distorted language production and perception, wordfinding difficulties, grammatical disturbances and verbal fluency deficits. To the best of our knowledge this case might be the first example that clearly demonstrates that a higher level motor planning disorder (apraxia) may be the origin of disrupted speech in CMS. In addition, identification of non-motor linguistic disturbances during follow-up add to the view that the cerebellum not only plays a crucial role in the planning and execution of speech but also in linguistic processing. Whether the cerebellum has a direct or indirect role in motor speech planning needs to be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes (Beckman \& Edwards, 1990; Fougeron \& Keating, 1997). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F0 and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F0 space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.},

Observers’ consonant identification performance across the various ‘facewear’ conditions was tested both in quiet listening conditions (Experiment 1), and when the speech stimuli were embedded in 8-talker babble noise (Experiment 2). Statistical analysis of the responses collected from 82 phonetically-untrained subjects (N = 43, quiet; N = 39, noise) revealed a significant AV effect in both experiments. However, the strength of the effect varied considerably as a function of facewear type. The findings are discussed in the context of previous research on AV speech perception, which aims to identify the facial regions that are particularly important for the extraction of visual speech cues.},

Acoustic measures were also obtained for 12 healthy controls for comparison to speakers with PD. Speakers read sentences using their typical speech style. Acoustic measures of speech rate, articulatory rate, fundamental frequency, sound pressure level and F2 interquartile range (F2 IQR) were obtained. A group of listeners judged sentence intelligibility using a computerized visual-analog scale. Relationships between judgments of intelligibility and acoustic measures were determined for individual speakers with PD. Relationships among acoustic measures were also quantified. Although considerable variability was noted, articulatory rate, fundamental frequency and F2 IQR were most frequently associated with within-speaker variation in sentence intelligibility. Results suggest that diversity among speakers with PD should be considered when interpreting results from group analyses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who undergo subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) often develop a deterioration in speech performance, but there is no clear consensus on the specific effects seen or the mechanism involved and little description of the impact of DBS on conversational speech. Furthermore, there has been no fiber tract connectivity analysis to identify the structures potentially modulated by DBS to cause such deficits. The main objective of this study was to quantify spontaneous speech performance and identify potential involvement of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTt) in patients who underwent STN DBS, because this tract has been implicated in speech deterioration. METHODS Spontaneous speech samples were obtained with STN DBS in both on and off modes in 35 patients with PD and assessed across multiple domains. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography seeded from the therapeutic DBS contacts was performed to identify the fiber tracts involved and, specifically, the DRTt. The position of active electrode contacts was assessed relative to that of the STN. RESULTS Fifteen patients with akinetic-rigid (AR) PD and 20 with tremor-dominant (TD) PD subtypes were identified. In the AR-PD subgroup of patients, in whom there was DRTt involvement, 71\% demonstrated much better overall speech and largely improved or unchanged fluency in the DBS-off condition. In patients with TD PD with DRTt involvement, 50\% demonstrated better overall speech in the off condition, and equivocal results regarding improved or worsened fluency were found. When there was minimal DRTt involvement, 75\% of patients with AR PD had better overall speech in the DBS-on condition and better or minimal fluency changes. Similarly, 83\% of patients with TD PD with minimal DRTt involvement had better or minimal overall speech and fluency changes in the on condition. More medially placed left electrode contacts were associated with more DRTt involvement in 77\% of patients (10 of 13). CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to have investigated a specific fiber tract involved in STN DBS in different subtypes of PD relative to its impact on spontaneous speech. At optimal therapeutic programming of STN DBS, overall spontaneous speech and fluency were affected more negatively in patients with AR PD than in those with TD PD when there was DRTt involvement. After fiber tract analysis and modeling, it was found that medially positioned left electrode contacts more often involved fibers of the DRTt. If possible, avoidance of the DRTt by using active electrode contacts that are positioned less medially, specifically in patients with AR PD, might result in less speech deterioration.},

  abstract = {To determine the specific acoustic changes that underlie improved vowel intelligibility in clear speech. Seven acoustic metrics were measured for conversational and clear vowels produced by 12 talkers-6 who previously were found (S. H. Ferguson, 2004) to produce a large clear speech vowel intelligibility effect for listeners with normal hearing identifying vowels in background noise (the big benefit talkers), and 6 who produced no clear speech vowel intelligibility benefit (the no benefit talkers). For vowel duration and for certain measures of the overall acoustic vowel space, the change from conversational to clear speech was significantly greater for big benefit talkers than for no benefit talkers. For measures of formant dynamics, in contrast, the clear speech effect was similar for the 2 groups. These results suggest that acoustic vowel space expansion and large vowel duration increases improve vowel intelligibility. In contrast, changing the dynamic characteristics of vowels seems not to contribute to improved clear speech vowel intelligibility. However, talker variability suggested that improved vowel intelligibility can be achieved using a variety of clear speech strategies, including some apparently not measured here.}

CONCLUSIONS: The statistical comparison carried out between all the acoustic voice parameters observed, extracted wearing and not wearing a surgical mask did not reveal any significant statistical difference.

It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have demonstrated a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. In proof-of-principle studies, we compared a variety of commonly available mask types and observed that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck gaiters or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by nonexperts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.},

Place of articulation and vowel height had significant effects on VOT and VOT ratio for all groups, and there were no PD versus control differences. PD medication had a greater effect on VOT than VOT ratio, reflecting a rate-related VOT change rather than a pure VOT change. These data support the usefulness of examining both VOT and VOT ratio with individuals with PD, as this allows for dissociation between rate-related VOT changes and true VOT changes.},

Our research examines mask wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April ─ September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May ─ October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) {$>$}200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask wearing policy for the general public through September reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75\% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Mean COVID-19 rates for states with at least 75\% mask adherence in the preceding month was 109.26 per 100,000 compared to 249.99 per 100,000 for those with less adherence. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Purpose The strength of the relationship between vowel centralization measures and perceptual ratings of dysarthria severity has varied considerably across reports. This article evaluates methods of acoustic-perceptual analysis to determine whether procedural changes can strengthen the association between these measures. Method Sixty-one speakers (17 healthy individuals and 44 speakers with dysarthria) read a standard passage. To obtain acoustic data, 2 points of formant extraction (midpoint and articulatory point) and 2 frequency measures (Hz and Bark) were trialed. Both vowel space area and an adapted formant centralization ratio were calculated using first and second formants of speakers' corner vowels. Twenty-eight listeners rated speech samples using different prompts: one with a focus on intelligibility, the other on speech precision. Results Perceptually, listener ratings of speech precision provided the best index of acoustic change. Acoustically, the combined use of an articulatory-based formant extraction point, Bark frequency units, and the formant centralization ratio was most effective in explaining perceptual ratings. This combination of procedures resulted in an increase of 17\% to 27\% explained variance between measures. Conclusions The procedures researchers use to assess articulatory impairment can significantly alter the strength of relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures. Procedures that maximize this relationship are recommended.},

Electropalatographic data from five Catalan speakers were collected for different consonants, i.e., the alveolar stop [n], the alveolopalatal stop [n] and the palatal approximant [j], in the sequences [iCi] and [aCe]. Results for [n] indicate more closure retraction in the mask versus nonmask condition occurring presumably when the mask is pressed forcefully against the face in front of the mouth. The use of the mask for [n] and [j] causes an increase in dorsopalatal contact, which reflects most likely a strategy of articulatory and/or perceptual compensation.},

  abstract = {Acoustic and kinematic analyses, as well as perceptual evaluation, were conducted on the speech of Parkinsonian and normal geriatric adults. As a group, the Parkinsonian speakers had very limited jaw movement compared to the normal geriatrics. For opening gestures, jaw displacements and velocities produced by the Parkinsonian subjects were about half those produced by the normal geriatrics. Lower lip movement amplitude and velocity also were reduced for the Parkinsonian speakers relative to the normal geriatrics, but the magnitude of the reduction was not as great as that seen in the jaw. Lower lip closing velocities expressed as a function of movement amplitude were greater for the Parkinsonian speakers than for the normal geriatrics. This increased velocity of lower lip movement may reflect a difference in the control of lip elevation for the Parkinsonian speakers, an effect that increased with the severity of dysarthria. Acoustically, the Parkinsonian subjects had reduced durations of vocalic segments, reduced formant transitions, and increased voice onset time compared to the normal geriatrics. These effects were greater for the more severe, compared to the milder, dysarthrics and were most apparent in the more complex, vocalic gestures.},

The finding is that talkers distinguish old words by shortening them. Two experiments show that old words are less intelligible than new words presented in isolation, but probably are not less identifiable in context. We infer that talkers may attenuate their productions of words when they can do so without sacrificing communicative efficacy. Old words can be reduced because they are repetitions of earlier presented items and because of the contextual support they receive. Two final experiments show that listeners can identify new and old words as such and that they can use information that a word is old more or less as they would use an anaphor to promote retrieval of the earlier production in its context.},

Speech materials from 10 individuals with PD and 10 gender- and age-matched neurologically healthy controls (HC) were recorded and analyzed. The four acoustic measures (peak intensity, peak F0, vowel duration, and acoustic vowel space area) of stressed and unstressed syllables were compared to determine which acoustic parameters are preferentially employed by each group to mark contrastive stress. The results indicated that individuals with PD exhibited significant changes in vowel duration and intensity of stressed/unstressed words to mark contrastive stress in similar ways to their HC counterparts. Unlike the HC group, individuals with PD did not demonstrate an expanded vowel space area (VSA) or employed changes in F0 to mark contrastive stress. Findings on which abilities are better preserved in the PD population for the purposes of marking contrastive stress add to our knowledge of prosodic deficits in this dysarthric population and can aid in the planning and executing of intervention services.},

  abstract = {Perceptual, acoustic and physiological (electromyographic and kinematic) studies addressing the features of the Parkinsonian speech are reviewed. Perceptual features are the following: 1) aprosody, i.e. monopitch, monoloudness, diminished stress contrasts and rate abnormalities, 2) impairment of articulation such as imprecise consonants, and 3) vocal quality deviation as harsh or breathy voice. The physical basis that is acoustic parameters corresponding to these perceptual impressions, such as fundamental frequency, intensity, duration, speech rate, have been analyzed. However, movement studies associated with electromyographic analysis in an important adjunct to more traditional investigations. The physiological studies are yet limited, they show that patients with Parkinson's disease have 1) reduced articulatory displacements relative to normal speakers, which may appear as rigidity, 2) improper coordination of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs or groups. Besides, some results show that pharmacological or surgical treatment improving akinesia, rigidity and tremor are not always successful in speech.},

Force transducers were used to sample ramp-and-hold force contractions generated by the upper lip, lower lip and tongue at 1- and 2-newton target force levels, as well as maximal force. Fourteen healthy control subjects and 14 parkinsonian patients participated in this study. After an overnight fast the patients were evaluated under two conditions: during bilateral stimulation and 1 h after stopping stimulation. With Vim stimulation, dynamic and static control of the articulatory organs was worsened while with STN stimulation it was greatly improved. The target of stimulation differently influences the oral system and modulates neuronal structures involved in speech.},

The following steps were used to develop the Thevenin model: (1) the long-term average speech spectrum of ten male speakers was measured; (2) the corresponding average vocal tract shape was estimated using linear prediction; (3) a Thevenin model of the voice was determined based on the vocal tract shape. Electroacoustic analogs are used to predict the mask speech spectra produced by the Thevenin model and a mouth simulator consisting of a loudspeaker equalized for free-air speech. Comparing the two spectra allows us to examine how the interaction between the driving point impedance of the voice and the load impedance of a mask affects objective speech intelligibility measurements. The Thevenin model is used in a voice simulator that is described in a future paper.},

  abstract = {Speech and voice changes are a central feature of the symptom complex of people with Parkinson’s disease (pwPD). Speaking is a social activity involving the pwPD, family, and the wider communicative context. Sensory-motor, cognitive-linguistic, and affective changes in Parkinson’s disease (PD) combine to alter communication, impacting on psychosocial quality-of-life, leading to risks of social withdrawal and increased depression and anxiety. The underlying pathophysiology of speech, voice, and communication difficulties in pwPD is multi-factorial and complex. Sensory-motor changes in the respiratory, phonatory, and articulatory subsystems, underscaling of effort, and central processing problems are further affected by broader cognitive-linguistic difficulties, and non-speech motor deficits. Many studies show that, when pwPD are asked to rate their own voice and how it functions in everyday situations, they show increased voice-related disability and negative impact relative to healthy controls. Voice treatment is integral to improving communication in pwPD. Studies show positive benefits from the perspective of pwPD and carers. Treatment approaches vary from one-to-one to group interventions, a singular focus on increasing loudness to more general voice exercises, and choral singing. The nature and underlying pathophysiology of speech, voice, and communication changes in pwPD are reviewed before exploring the effects of voice treatment programs and pwPD and carer perceptions of their effect. Larger scale, better powered, controlled trials of intervention for voice and speech that measure clinically and socially relevant outcomes are finally underway. Future research should also focus on issues of treatment compliance, practicality (for service delivery and use), and long-term follow-up outcomes. The role of carers in longer-term maintenance represents a further important area of exploration.},

Method: an integrative literature review. The PICO strategy was used to elaborate the question. The search was conducted in four databases: PubMed, SciVerse Scopus, WebofScience and EMBASE, considering any period of time.  Results: a total of 32 studies were included from the 561 studies identified, and they were presented in two categories: “Conditions for reuse” and “Reprocessing the masks”. Of the evaluated research studies, seven(21.8\%) addressed the reuse of the N95 face respirator mask or equivalent and 25(78.1\%) evaluated different reprocessing methods, namely: ultraviolet germicidal irradiation(14); hydrogen peroxide(8); vapor methods(14); using dry heat(5) and chemical methods(sodium hypochlorite[6], ethanol[4] and sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate and dimethyldioxirane[1]). We emphasize that different methods were used in one same article.  Conclusion: no evidence was found to support safe reprocessing of face respirator masks. In addition, reuse is contraindicated due to the risk of self-contamination and inadequate sealing.           ,              Objetivo: analizar la evidencia científica disponible sobre los diferentes métodos de reprocesamiento y las condiciones necesarias para la reutilización de una mascarilla respiratoria facial N95 o equivalente.

La búsqueda se realizó en cuatro bases de datos PubMed, Sci Verse Scopus, Web of Science y EMBASE sin límite de tiempo.  Resultados: de los 561 estudios identificados 32 fueron incluidos y presentados en dos categorías: “condiciones de reutilización” y “reprocesamiento de mascarillas”. De las investigaciones evaluadas, siete (21,8\%) abordaron la reutilización de la mascarilla respiratoria facial N95 o equivalente y 25 (78,1\%) evaluaron diferentes métodos de reprocesamiento: irradiación germicida ultravioleta (14); peróxido de hidrógeno (8); métodos de vapor (14); uso de calor seco (5) y métodos químicos hipoclorito de sodio (6), etanol (4) y cloruro de sodio con bicarbonato de sodio y dimetildioxirano (1). Cabe destacar que en un mismo artículo se utilizaron métodos diferentes.  Conclusión: no se encontró evidencia que apoye el reprocesamiento seguro de las mascarillas respiratorias. Además, la reutilización está contraindicada debido al riesgo de autocontaminación y sellado inadecuado.           ,              Objetivo: analisar as evidências científicas disponíveis sobre os diferentes métodos de reprocessamento e as condições necessárias para reuso de máscara respiratória facial do tipo N95 ou equivalente.

  abstract = {Purpose                                Prior work suggests that voice onset time (VOT) may be impacted by laryngeal tension: VOT means decrease when individuals with typical voices increase their fundamental frequency (                 f                 o                 ) and VOT variability is increased in individuals with vocal hyperfunction, a voice disorder characterized by increased laryngeal tension. This study further explored the relationship between VOT and laryngeal tension during increased                 f                 o                 , vocal effort, and vocal strain.                                                        Method                                Sixteen typical speakers of American English were instructed to produce VOT utterances under four conditions: baseline, high pitch, effort, and strain. Repeated-measures analysis of variance models were used to analyze the effects of condition on VOT means and standard deviations (                 SD                 s); pairwise comparisons were used to determine significant differences between conditions.                                                        Results                                Voicing, condition, and their interaction significantly affected VOT means. Voiceless VOT means significantly decreased for high pitch (                 p                 {$<$} .001) relative to baseline; however, no changes in voiceless VOT means were found for effort or strain relative to baseline. Although condition had a significant effect on VOT                 SD                 s, there were no significant differences between effort, strain, and high pitch conditions relative to baseline.                                                        Conclusions               Speakers with typical voices likely engage different musculature to increase pitch than to increase vocal effort and strain. The increased VOT variability present with vocal hyperfunction is not seen in individuals with typical voices using increased effort and strain, supporting the assertion that this feature of vocal hyperfunction may be related to disordered vocal motor control rather than resulting from effortful voice production.},

Alternative Semantics provides an insightful account of what prosodic focus means, and gives us a notation that can help with better characterizing focus-related phenomena and the terminology used to describe them. We can also translate theoretical ideas about focus and givenness into this notation to facilitate a comparison between frameworks. The discussion will partly be structured by an evaluation of the theories of Givenness, the theory of Relative Givenness, and Unalternative Semantics, but we will cover a range of other ideas and proposals in the process. The chapter concludes with a discussion of phonological issues, and of association with focus.},

  abstract = {Languages vary in the types of contexts that affect prosodic prominence. This paper reports on a production study investigating how different types of foci influence prosody in Polish. The results show that focus and givenness in Polish are both marked prosodically, with pitch and intensity as the main acoustic correlates. Polish patterns like En-glish in showing prosodic focus marking in a broad range of contexts, and differs in this regard from Romance languages, despite the fact that aspects of the prosodic system of Polish are more similar to Romance. Finally, the results do not support the claim in [7, 8] that word prominence is shifted from the penult syllable to the initial syllable under focus.}

Six speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease served as subjects. Paced temporal alterations were created by slowing each speaker to 60\% of his/her habitual speaking rate. The synthetic alterations were created by modifying the habitual rate speech samples using digital signal processing. Three types of synthetic alterations were examined: Pause Altered, Speech Duration Altered, and Pause and Speech Duration Altered. The 60\% of habitual speaking rate condition was more intelligible than the synthetic conditions. In addition, none of the synthetic alterations were found to be more intelligible than samples produced at habitual speaking rates. The results suggest that simple alterations of speech signals do not explain the differences in intelligibility that have been observed when parkinsonian dysarthric speakers reduce speaking rates. Reasons for the failure of synthetic alterations to increase speech intelligibility scores are discussed.},

Previous research indicated increases in both speech and pause time when the speaking rate of persons with Parkinson disease was reduced. This preliminary investigation sought to examine what occurs when speech time increases with decreases in speech rate. The data indicated that, despite similar levels of dysarthria and disease severity, there were different patterns of segmental duration change when speaking rate was reduced. Two of the three participants showed increases in duration toward that obtained from normal controls when rate was reduced. Not all changes in segmental duration were considered perceptually important. The need for additional acoustic measures and an examination of the interaction between consonant and vowel duration change is discussed},

It is thought to be measurable as equalized syllable durations. There are seemingly contradictory prosodic-temporal characteristics of ataxic dysarthria: perceptually characterised as prosodic excess as well as phonatory-prosodic insufficiency and acoustic characteristics including signs of isochrony as well as variability. This study investigates the temporal characteristics at two levels, duration and variability of syllable durations and the durations of interstress intervals. A group of 14 individuals with MS and ataxic dysarthria as well as 15 control subjects were studied. It was concluded that individuals with ataxic dysarthria and MS showed (a) for syllables: significantly increased durations and decreased intrautterance variability (more isochrony or syllable equalization) as well as significantly increased interutterance variability; (b) for interstress intervals: significantly increased durations and increased variability (less isochrony). The results point to inflexibility as well as instability of temporal control, which could contribute to the explanation of why the perceptual characteristics are contradictory.},

  abstract = {The study investigated the speech adaptations by older adults (OA) with and without age-related hearing loss made to communicate effectively in challenging communicative conditions. Acoustic analyses were carried out on spontaneous speech produced during a problem-solving task (diapix) carried out by talker pairs in different listening conditions. There were 83 talkers of Southern British English. Fifty-seven talkers were OAs aged 65–84, 30 older adults with normal hearing (OANH), and 27 older adults with hearing loss (OAHL) [mean pure tone average (PTA) 0.250–4\,kHz: 27.7\,dB HL]. Twenty-six talkers were younger adults (YA) aged 18–26 with normal hearing. Participants were recorded while completing the diapix task with a conversational partner (YA of the same sex) when (a) both talkers heard normally (NORM), (b) the partner had a simulated hearing loss, and (c) both talkers heard babble noise. Irrespective of hearing status, there were age-related differences in some acoustic characteristics of YA and OA speech produced in NORM, most likely linked to physiological factors. In challenging conditions, while OANH talkers typically patterned with YA talkers, OAHL talkers made adaptations more consistent with an increase in vocal effort. The study suggests that even mild presbycusis in healthy OAs can affect the speech adaptations made to maintain effective communication.},

  abstract = {Multisite research designs involving cluster randomization are becoming increasingly important in educational and behavioral research. Researchers would like to compute effect size indexes based on the standardized mean difference to compare the results of cluster-randomized studies (and corresponding quasi-experiments) with other studies and to combine information across studies in meta-analyses. This article addresses the problem of defining effect sizes in multilevel designs and computing estimates of those effect sizes and their standard errors from information that is likely to be reported in journal articles. Three effect sizes are defined corresponding to different standardizations. Estimators of each effect size index are also presented along with their sampling distributions (including standard errors).},

Little is known, however, about the extent to which SLPs implement these methods into their clinical practice. The current study explores the assessment and intervention practices used by SLPs in two states in the US for students who speak African American English (AAE), including the types and frequency of clinical practices. 247 SLPs completed an online survey regarding clinical practices for students who speak AAE as well as a questionnaire regarding their knowledge of the linguistic features of AAE. Half of SLPs reported using modified or alternative assessment practices the majority of the time or some of the time for students who speak AAE; however, SLPs reported using modified or alternative treatment practices less often. Modified scoring of standardized assessments and selecting different intervention strategies were the most commonly reported clinical practices. Knowledge of linguistic features of AAE was a significant predictor of the frequency with which SLPs report implementing modified or alternative assessment and intervention practices and SLPs with the highest levels of knowledge of AAE utilize different clinical practices than those with lower levels of knowledge of AAE. Additional information is needed about the most effective clinical practices for students who speak AAE and the barriers SLPs face to implementing nondiscriminatory clinical practices.},

The computed EGG spectrograms allowed us to differentiate various kinds of phonatory disturbances: intervals with subharmonic energy (“low-frequency segments”), “noise-like regions,” and abrupt shifts of fundamental frequency (F0). Female PD subjects presented with a significantly increased portion of subharmonic segments and with significantly more abrupt F0 shifts as compared to both controls and male PD subjects. Presumably, these alterations in spectral energy distribution reflect different oscillatory modes of the glottal source. Thus, PD seems to have a differential impact on phonation in men and women. Conceivably, these gender-specific vocal dysfunctions are determined by the well-known sexual dimorphism of laryngeal size.},

The test sentences comprised a systematically varied nonsense word embedded into a carrier phrase. Anticipatory and perseverative coarticulation were characterized by different patterns of durational and spectral features. Inter-speaker variability was considerable, particularly with respect to anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation. As a rule, slowing of speaking rate resulted in a decrease of perseverative coarticulation in the presence of unchanged anticipatory effects.

  abstract = {In order to analyze the impact of cerebellar disorders on temporal and spectral aspects of coarticulation, 9 individuals with cerebellar dysfunction and 9 controls were asked to produce test sentences comprising a target vowel (V = [a], [i], or [u]) within a schwa-t-V-t-schwa environment. The control speakers were investigated both at their habitual speech tempo and under a slow speaking condition. The squared distances between averaged FFT spectra served as a quantitative estimate of target-induced coarticulation, a method that can be applied to consonants as well as vowels, and which avoids the shortcomings of formant analysis. In order to test the significance of coarticulation effects at the level of individual speakers and to obtain F values as a further measure of the strength of coarticulation, multivariate tests of target effects were performed, with the first 6 principal components derived from the spectra of each speaker. First, inconsistent patterns of anticipatory vowel-to-vowel (W) interactions emerged across individuals, and neither significant group differences nor any effects of speech rate could be detected. The underlying control mechanisms thus seem to be segment-linked subject-specific specifications of the pretarget vowel, uncompromised by cerebellar dysfunction. Second, all participants exhibited highly significant anticipatory [t(h)]-to-vowel (CV) coarticulation. This effect was slightly smaller in the cerebellar group than in the control group, which can be at least partially explained by reduced spectral distances among the 3 target vowels. Speech rate did not influence the CV effects of the control group. As concerns temporal aspects of coarticulation, no significant group differences emerged in terms of length adjustments of the pretarget consonant to the intrinsic duration of the target vowel. Third, ataxic speakers showed a tendency toward enlarged perseverative vowel-to-[t(h)] (VC) and W effects if their slow speech rate was taken into account. Retentive coarticulation turned out to be similar in slow ataxic speakers and in fast-speaking controls. However, significant attenuation of these effects emerged in the latter group under the condition of decreased speech tempo. In summary, these results corroborate the suggestion of different mechanisms of gestural overlap in the temporal domain: Whereas perseverative coarticulation, presumably, reflects biomechanical or motor constraints, anticipation seems to represent higher level phonetic processing.},

  abstract = {Ataxic dysarthria is a disorder affecting the naturalness of speech due to damage to the cerebellum, a neural structure critical for the timing, scaling, and sequencing of speech movements (Ackermann, Vogel, Petersen, \& Poremba, 1992; Diener \& Dichgans, 1992; Duffy, 2013; Rampello, Rampello, Patti, \& Zappia, 2016). In healthy individuals, the cerebellum facilitates speech naturalness by integrating sensory feedback (auditory and somatosensory) with cortical motor plans for speech (Ackermann et al., 2007; Duffy, 2013; Spencer \& Rogers, 2005). This sensorimotor integration allows the cerebellum to adjust the temporal and prosodic properties of the motor plans according to the current muscular and phonetic environment of the speech production system. These adjustments result in smooth, coordinated speech movements. When cerebellar functioning is diminished in ataxic dysarthria, prosody is impaired because the production of pitch, loudness, and articulation are imprecise, poorly timed, and uncoordinated (Darley, Aronson, \& Brown, 1969). Although the cerebellar dysfunction for sequencing sounds and words in ataxic dysarthria is known (Spencer \& Rogers, 2005), at the present, little is known for how impaired sensorimotor integration in the cerebellum impacts naturalness for prosodic production. The goal of this dissertation is to characterize the deficits in sensorimotor integration in ataxic dysarthria to better understand the underlying mechanisms for prosodic impairment in speech production. We hypothesize that the reduced naturalness in ataxia is due to prosodic impairment resulting from disrupted feedback control by neural circuits involving the cerebellum. More specifically, we theorized that ataxia results in a diminished ability to integrate sensory feedback with (i) prior motor plans for speech, affecting reflexive corrective mechanisms for intonation, as well as (ii) future motor plans for speech, affecting predictive scaling mechanisms for adjusting downstream intonational targets. Inherent in this hypothesis is that sensorimotor integration is vital for both reflexive and predictive response mechanisms for intonation. Healthy speakers make reflexive, rapid vocal responses to pitch auditory feedback perturbations in order to maintain a steady F0 (Burnett, Freedland, Larson, \& Hain, 1998), and they enhance the acoustic properties of a phrase-final prominent word (i.e. pitch accent) after a perturbation earlier in the phrase (Hilger, Cole, Kim, Lester-Smith, \& Larson, in press). Reflexive responses during steady vocalization demonstrate a corrective mechanism for sensory integration with prior motor plans. Adjustments to downstream pitch accents in phrase production demonstrate a predictive mechanism to adjust upcoming intonation targets based on feedback of the current prosodic environment of the phrase. In this dissertation, we demonstrate that auditory feedback control is impaired in ataxia because of over-corrected reflexive responses and impaired sensory prediction to scale phrasal stress. Overall, the goal for this research is that understanding the sensorimotor integration impairment in ataxic dysarthria will allow us to develop more effective therapy techniques for enhancing speech naturalness and intelligibility.},

  abstract = {Purpose               In this study, we investigated how the direction and timing of a perturbation in voice pitch auditory feedback during phrasal production modulated the magnitude and latency of the pitch-shift reflex as well as the scaling of acoustic production of anticipatory intonation targets for phrasal prominence and boundary.                                         Method               Brief pitch auditory feedback perturbations (±200 cents for 200-ms duration) were applied during the production of a target phrase on the first or the second word of the phrase. To replicate previous work, we first measured the magnitude and latency of the pitch-shift reflex as a function of the direction and timing of the perturbation within the phrase. As a novel approach, we also measured the adjustment in the production of the phrase-final prominent word as a function of perturbation direction and timing by extracting the acoustic correlates of pitch, loudness, and duration.                                         Results               The pitch-shift reflex was greater in magnitude after perturbations on the first word of the phrase, replicating the results from Mandarin speakers in an American English–speaking population. Additionally, the production of the phrase-final prominent word was acoustically enhanced (lengthened vowel duration and increased intensity and fundamental frequency) after perturbations earlier in the phrase, but more so after perturbations on the first word in the phrase.                                         Conclusion               The timing of the pitch perturbation within the phrase modulated both the magnitude of the pitch-shift reflex and the production of the prominent word, supporting our hypothesis that speakers use auditory feedback to correct for immediate production errors and to scale anticipatory intonation targets during phrasal production.},

A second set of 1520 signals was identical to these stimuli except that a falling pitch contour was used. The identification error rate for the flat-formant, flat-pitch signals was 27.3\%, several times greater than the 5.6\% error rate shown by Peterson and Barney's listeners. The introduction of a falling pitch contour resulted in a small but statistically reliable reduction in the error rate. The implications of these results for interpreting pattern recognition studies using the Peterson and Barney database are discussed. Results are also discussed in relation to the role of dynamic cues in vowel identification.},

Formant contours for F1-F4 were measured from LPC spectra using a custom interactive editing tool. For comparison with the PB data, formant patterns were sampled at a time that was judged by visual inspection to be maximally steady. Analysis of the formant data shows numerous differences between the present data and those of PB, both in terms of average frequencies of F1 and F2, and the degree of overlap among adjacent vowels. As with the original study, listening tests showed that the signals were nearly always identified as the vowel intended by the talker. Discriminant analysis showed that the vowels were more poorly separated than the PB data based on a static sample of the formant pattern. However, the vowels can be separated with a high degree of accuracy if duration and spectral change information is included.},

The data were specifically examined for range, velocity, and consistency (reproducibility) of the movements of the articulators, as well as the pattern of coordination of the different articulators involved. It was found in the case of ataxic dysarthria of cerebellar origin, for example, that the dynamic patterns were best represented as a difficulty in the initiation of purposeful movements and an inconsistency of articulatory movements, particularly in the repetitive production of a monosyllable. On EMG, breakdown of the rhythmical patterns in the articulatory muscles was quite obvious in the repetition of a monosyllable. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), decrease in the range and velocity of movements was noted. This resulted from reduced neuromuscular units (NMU) activities manifested in clinical EMG. Analysis of the dynamic aspects of the dysarthrias is a promising approach for elucidating the nature of central problems of speech production and for a differential diagnosis of various types of dysarthrias.},

In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (“source control”) with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Patients with voice problems commonly report increased vocal effort, regardless of the underlying pathophysiology. Previous studies investigating vocal effort and voice production have used a range of methods to quantify vocal effort. The goals of the current study were to use the Borg CR100 effort scale to (a) demonstrate the relation between vocal intensity or vocal level (dB) and tasked vocal effort goals and (b) investigate the repeated measure reliability of vocal level at tasked effort level goals.                                         Method               Three types of speech (automatic, read, and structured spontaneous) were elicited at four vocal effort level goals on the Borg CR100 scale (2, 13, 25, and 50) from 20 participants (10 females and 10 males).                                         Results               Participants' vocal level reliably changed approximately 5 dB between the elicited effort level goals; this difference was statistically significant and repeatable. Biological females produced a voice with consistently less intensity for a vocal effort level goal compared to biological males.                                         Conclusions               The results indicate the utility of the Borg CR100 in tracking effort in voice production that is repeatable with respect to vocal level (dB). Future research will investigate other metrics of voice production with the goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying vocal effort and the external environmental influences on the perception of vocal effort.},

A well-implanted lead in an appropriately selected patient is useless without the application of proper stimulation settings. DBS therapy introduces in many cases a delicate balance of electrical and pharma- cological treatment that requires a critical understanding of the principles of pulse generator programming. While the countless number of possible setting combinations seems to make programming a complicated and time-consuming endeavor, a systematic approach can prove invaluable in optimizing DBS therapy. This chapter outlines the general principles of stimulation, including the parameters that may be modulated to optimize therapy. We also review the common steps required to select optimal DBS contacts independent of the anatomical target and general troubleshooting guidelines. Programming issues relative to individual brain targets are addressed, which include the elements of anatomy, contact selection, medication adjustment (when appropriate), and specific stimulation-related side effects.},

  abstract = {The study investigated the articulatory basis of locus equations, regression lines relating F2 at the start of a Consonant-Vowel (CV) transition to F2 at the middle of the vowel, with C fixed and V varying. Several studies have shown that consonants of different places of articulation have locus equation slopes that descend from labial to velar to alveolar, and intercept magnitudes that increase in the opposite order. Using formulas from the theory of bivariate regression that express regression slopes and intercepts in terms of standard deviations and averages of the variables, it is shown that the slope directly encodes a well-established measure of coarticulation resistance. It is also shown that intercepts are directly related to the degree to which the tongue body assists the formation of the constriction for the consonant. Moreover, it is shown that the linearity of locus equations and the linear relation between locus equation slopes and intercepts originates in linearity in articulation between the horizontal position of the tongue dorsum in the consonant and to that in the vowel. It is concluded that slopes and intercepts of acoustic locus equations are measures of articulator synergy.},

The overall aim was to investigate how speech and language pathologists (SLPs), in Sweden are working with people with aphasia and their families and what their professional experiences are.Method. A cross-sectional study with a descriptive and comparative design. An 84-item study-specific questionnaire was sent to all Swedish SLPs, affiliated to SLOF (the Swedish professional association and trade union).Results. The response rate was 72.5\% (n = 758). Thirty per cent worked with people with aphasia and typically met with their families. The participants considered the involvement of families as very important, especially concerning providing information of aphasia and training of communication strategies. However, involvement of families was limited due to a shortage of time, but also to perceived limited skill and knowledge.Conclusions. There was an evident discrepancy between what the participants claimed to be an important part of their work, and their actual practice. It is suggested that to facilitate family intervention, this should be explicitly expressed in both local and national guidelines. The content of the SLP education, and the need of further education and implementation of new knowledge into clinical practice also requires consideration.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported cognition, speech, communication and swallowing changes in a large sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) in Sweden. A second aim was to update information about speech and language pathology (SLP) services received by people with MS (pwMS). METHOD: Self-ratings of cognition, speech/communication and swallowing registered by pwMS between 2012 and 2018 were retrieved from the Swedish MS Registry. In addition, more detailed information about speech, communication, swallowing and provision of SLP services was collected using an online survey distributed via a national patient organization. RESULTS: In total, entries from 5,289 pwMS were retrieved from the MS Registry. Nearly two thirds of the respondents reported that cognition was affected to some degree, whereas approximately one third perceived some difficulties with speech/communication. A smaller group reported swallowing problems. The majority of those who reported problems with speech/communication also reported problems with cognition. Among the 440 individuals who responded to the MS survey, word-finding difficulties were the most frequently self-reported problem related to communication, and the second most common problem was getting off topic. In all, close to four out of five respondents experienced at least one symptom related to speech and communication, such as speech-related fatigue or imprecise articulation. Swallowing difficulties were reported by one out of four respondents in the MS survey. As a result of their speech difficulties, up to one in three experienced changes in professional or social roles and participation. A limited number of respondents had received SLP services, the most common intervention being voice training. CONCLUSIONS: In MS, changes associated with cognition as well as speech/communication are frequent, cognitive-linguistic symptoms being the most common. Swallowing difficulties are also relatively prevalent. Access to SLP services seems to be insufficient compared to prevalence of perceived symptoms. Considering that the majority of pwMS are part of the working-age population, access to SLP services must be more highly prioritized and must address cognitive-linguistic problems as well as voice, speech and swallowing dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Respirators have been found to degrade communication effectiveness when wearers speak face-to-face. However, little is known about communication effectiveness when using the telephone and wearing a respirator. Eleven pairs of subjects were asked to pronounce and identify words chosen from Modified Rhyme Test lists. Each word appeared on a computer screen in one room and the speaker said the word into the telephone. The listener in another room identified the word and typed it into a computer linked with the first. Subjects wore U.S. Army M40 full-facepiece air-purifying respirators with hoods. Three different speech diaphragm arrangements and two hood materials were tested. Results show that accuracy suffered by about 10\% when respirators and hoods were worn compared with the control condition. Word identification speed was one-third to one-half of the control (no respirator or hood) condition depending on specific equipment worn.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: New developments in speech interaction technology warrant the assumption that some of the interaction problems at anesthesia workplaces can be solved using speech interaction. One application might be the documentation of the anesthetic procedure. METHOD: To investigate this hypothesis, a speech input system was developed for a commercially available patient monitor (Datex-Ohmeda AS/3 Anesthesia Monitor with Record-Keeper), which in addition to standard functions also facilitates the generation of the anesthesia record. The speech input system was based on the IBM ViaVoice speech recognition technology (version Millennium Pro). The speech input device was preliminarily tested by 5 anesthetists wearing surgical masks under laboratory conditions and through retrospectively documenting 4 to 5 anesthetic procedures (each 12 to 17 documentation entries) in a calm situation. The speech interactive documentation procedure was compared with the conventional keyboard documentation procedure. RESULTS: The test persons achieved an overall word recognition rate between 72\% and 92.4\%. Between 76.5\% and 97.7\% of the single word commands could be completed without any corrections. The same qualifier held for 58.5\% to 86.3\% of the two- and three-word commands. Despite high speech recognition error rates, almost all documentation entries (236 of 238) could be finished using speech interaction. Comparing both documentation techniques, speech interaction was said to be more intuitive and caused less frustration than the keyboard documentation procedure. However, speech interactive documentation was rated less controllable because of the high speech recognition error rates and bccause the auditive feedback dialogues took too long. CONCLUSIONS: Modern speech recognition tools are still not advanced enough to facilitate the design of applications with an almost natural speech interface and widespread user acceptance. Nevertheless, many tasks in anesthesia have the necessary characteristics to be optimally supported by speech interaction. In contrast to earlier approaches to speech-interactive anesthesia workplaces, successful application today depends on the question of design rather than solely on that of technology. Many of the constraints and drawbacks of current technology can be overcome through appropriate design measures. The goals must focus first on identifying task areas in intensive care where speech-interaction can yield real benefit in terms of work efficiency, and second on developing and evaluating an ergonomic design of speech interaction. The intended users seem to look forward to the incorporation of speech interaction at the workplace.},

  abstract = {Speakers naturally adopt a special “clear” (CLR) speaking style in order to be better understood by listeners who are moderately impaired in their ability to understand speech due to a hearing impairment, the presence of background noise, or both. In contrast, speech intended for nonimpaired listeners in quiet environments is referred to as “conversational” (CNV). Studies have shown that the intelligibility of CLR speech is usually higher than that of CNV speech in adverse circumstances. It is not known which individual acoustic features or combinations of features cause the higher intelligibility of CLR speech. The objective of this study is to determine the contribution of some acoustic features to intelligibility for a single speaker. The proposed method creates “hybrid” (HYB) speech stimuli that selectively combine acoustic features of one sentence spoken in the CNV and CLR styles. The intelligibility of these stimuli is then measured in perceptual tests, using 96 phonetically balanced sentences. Results for one speaker show significant sentence-level intelligibility improvements over CNV speech when replacing certain combinations of short-term spectra, phoneme identities, and phoneme durations of CNV speech with those from CLR speech, but no improvements for combinations involving fundamental frequency, energy, or nonspeech events (pauses).},

Methods In the Einstein Aging Study, a diverse community cohort (n = 428; mean age = 78.1; 66\% female; 54\% non-White), equivalence testing was used to examine concordance between the T-MoCA and the corresponding in-person MoCA assessment. Receiver operating characteristic analyses examined the diagnostic ability to discriminate between mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition. Conversion methods from T-MoCA to the MoCA are presented. Results Education, race/ethnicity, gender, age, self-reported cognitive concerns, and telephone administration difficulties were associated with both modes of administration; however, when examining the difference between modalities, these factors were not significant. Sensitivity and specificity for the T-MoCA (using Youden's index optimal cut) were 72\% and 59\%, respectively. Discussion The T-MoCA demonstrated sufficient psychometric properties to be useful for screening of MCI, especially when clinic visits are not feasible.},

  abstract = {The measurement of intelligibility in dysarthric individuals is a major concern in clinical assessment and management and in research on dysarthria. The measurement objective is complicated by the fact that intelligibility is not an absolute quantity but rather a relative quantity that depends on variables such as test material, personnel, training, test procedures, and state of the speaker. This paper reviews scaling procedures and item identification tests as they have been applied to dysarthric speech. Based in part on previous studies of speech of the hearing impaired, a profile has been designed to direct research on the acoustic or physiologic correlates of dysarthric intelligibility impairment. In addition, a word intelligibility test is proposed for use with dysarthric speakers. This test is designed to examine 19 acoustic-phonetic contrasts that are likely to (a) be sensitive to dysarthric impairment and (b) contribute significantly to speech intelligibility. Preliminary data from a sample of subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are presented to illustrate the use of this test in the phonetic interpretation of intelligibility impairment.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar disease affects a number of skilled movements, including those in speech. Ataxic dysarthria, the speech disorder that typically accompanies cerebellar disease, was studied by acoustic methods. Control subjects and subjects with ataxic dysarthria were recorded while performing a number of speaking tasks, including sustained vowel phonation, syllable repetition, monosyllabic word production (intelligibility test), sentence recitation, and conversation. Acoustic data derived from the speech samples confirmed the hypothesis that temporal dysregulation is a primary component of the speech disorder. The data also show that the nature of the disorder varies with the speaking task. This result agrees with observations on other motor systems in subjects with cerebellar disease and may be evidence of a dissociation of impairments. Suggestions are offered on the selection of measures for a given task and on the role of the cerebellum in the regulation of speaking.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach, Cepstral Separation Difference (CSD), for quantification of speech impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). CSD represents a ratio between the magnitudes of glottal (source) and supra-glottal (filter) log-spectrums acquired using the source-filter speech model. The CSD-based features were tested on a database consisting of 240 clinically rated running speech samples acquired from 60 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. The Guttmann (m2) monotonic correlations between the CSD features and the speech symptom severity ratings were strong (up to 0.78). This correlation increased with the increasing textual difficulty in different speech tests. CSD was compared with some nonCSD speech features (harmonic ratio, harmonic-to-noise ratio and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) for speech symptom characterization in terms of consistency and reproducibility. The high intra-class correlation coefficient (greater than 0.9) and analysis of variance indicates that CSD features can be used reliably to distinguish between severity levels of speech impairment. Results motivate the use of CSD in monitoring speech symptoms in PD.},

  abstract = {A problem in the clinical assessment of running speech in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to track underlying deficits in a number of speech components including respiration, phonation, articulation and prosody, each of which disturbs the speech intelligibility. A set of 13 features, including the cepstral separation difference and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were computed to represent deficits in each individual speech component. These features were then used in training a support vector machine (SVM) using n-fold cross validation. The dataset used for method development and evaluation consisted of 240 running speech samples recorded from 60 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. These speech samples were clinically rated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Examination of Speech (UPDRS-S). The classification accuracy of SVM was 85\% in 3 levels of UPDRS-S scale and 92\% in 2 levels with the average area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves of around 91\%. The strong classification ability of selected features and the SVM model supports suitability of this scheme to monitor speech symptoms in PD.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses consonant articulation errors in dysarthric speech produced by seven American-English native speakers with cerebral palsy. Twenty-three consonant phonemes were transcribed with diacritics as necessary in order to represent non-phoneme misarticulations. Error frequencies were examined with respect to six variables: articulatory complexity, place of articulation, and manner of articulation of the target phoneme; and change in articulatory complexity, place, and manner resulting from the misarticulation. Results showed that target phonemes with high articulatory complexity were most often misarticulated, independent of intelligibility, but low-intelligibility speakers reduced the complexity of target consonants more frequently. All speakers tended to misarticulate to the adjacent place of the target place, but this pattern was most prominent for high-intelligibility speakers. Low- and mid-intelligibility speakers produced more manner errors than high-intelligibility speakers. Based on these results, a two-part model of consonant articulation errors is proposed for CP-associated spastic dysarthia.},

Speakers read sentences and produced spontaneous speech. Acoustic measures of fundamental frequency, phrase-final syllable lengthening, intensity and speech rate were obtained. A group of listeners judged speech naturalness using a nine-point Likert scale. Relationships between judgements of speech naturalness and acoustic measures were determined for individual speakers with PD. Relationships among acoustic measures also were quantified. Despite variability between speakers, measures of mean F0, intensity range, articulation rate, average syllable duration, duration of final syllables, vocalic nucleus length of final unstressed syllables and pitch accent of final syllables emerged as possible acoustic variables contributing to within-speaker variations in speech naturalness. Results suggest that acoustic measures correlate with speech naturalness, but in dysarthric speech they depend on the speaker due to the within-speaker variation in speech impairment.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The aim of this study was to quantify changes in speech intelligibility in two cohorts of people with Parkinson's disease (PD; those with and without deep brain stimulation [DBS]) across a broad range of self-selected speech rate alterations in (a) read sentences and (b) extemporaneous speech (monologues).                                         Method               Four speaker groups participated in this study: younger and older controls, people with PD undergoing standard pharmaceutical treatment, and people with PD and DBS. Naïve listeners rated the intelligibility of read sentences and extemporaneous monologues, spoken by participants at seven self-selected speech rates from very slow to very fast. Intelligibility was modeled as a function of group, speech rate condition, and speech task.                                         Results               Overall, compared to habitual speech rate, slower speech rate conditions were not associated with changes in speech intelligibility, whereas faster-than-habitual conditions were associated in declines in intelligibility. Results were mediated by group and task effects, such that talkers with PD and DBS were more likely to see intelligibility benefits at slower self-selected speech rates and less likely to see detriments at faster rates, and these differences were amplified in monologues compared to sentences.                                         Conclusion               Findings suggest differences in the ways in which slower and faster speech rate adjustments impact speech intelligibility in people with PD with and without DBS, with the latter demonstrating greater magnitudes of change.},

  abstract = {Voicing control in stop consonants has often been measured by means of voice onset          time (VOT) and discussed in terms of interarticulator timing. However, control of          voicing also involves details of laryngeal setting and management of sub- and supraglottal          pressure levels, and many of these factors are known to undergo developmental change.          Mechanical and aerodynamic conditions at the glottis may therefore vary considerably          in normal populations as functions of age and/or sex. The current study collected          oral airflow, intraoral pressure, and acoustic signals from normal English-speaking          adults and children producing stop consonants and /h/ embedded in a short carrier          utterance. Measures were made of stop VOTs, /h/ voicing and flow characteristics,          and subglottal pressure during /p/ closures. Clear age and gender effects were observed          for /h/: Fully voiced /h/ was most common in men, and /h/ voicing and flow data showed          the highest variability among the 5-year-olds. For individual participants, distributional          measures of VOT in /p t/ were correlated with distributional measures of voicing in          /h/. The data indicate that one cannot assume comparable laryngeal conditions across          speaker groups. This, in turn, implies that VOT acquisition in children cannot be          interpreted purely in terms of developing interarticulator timing control, but must          also reflect growing mastery over voicing itself. Further, differences in laryngeal          structure and aerodynamic quantities may require men and women to adopt somewhat different          strategies for achieving distinctive consonantal voicing contrasts.},

  abstract = {Objective: A scoping review was undertaken to identify strategies which increase telephone accessibility for workers with hearing loss. Design: The scoping review protocol outlined by the Joanna Brigg’s Institute was used. Terms relating to hearing loss, telephones, and management strategies were searched in CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. An additional hand search was also conducted for two journals and two publications from consumer organisations as they were known to publish relevant articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the resulting 1086 texts. Strategies from the selected texts were organised into categories through thematic analyses. Study sample: Eighty-four texts were included in the review. Results: The effective telephone strategies fall into the following categories: amplifying the telephone signal, reducing background noise, listening to the telephone through both ears, accessing text-based supports to understanding telephone speech, using Internet-based telephony, optimising mobile phones, improving telephone skills and communication strategies, and requesting accommodation in the workplace. Conclusion: Strategies exist by which the telephone can be made more accessible to workers with hearing loss. These have the potential to benefit both workers and their employers.},

We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60\% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of “fit” and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently.

  abstract = {Sentences spoken “clearly” (and slowly) are significantly more intelligible than those spoken “conversationally” for hearing-impaired listeners in a variety of backgrounds [Picheny, Durlach, and Braida, J. Speech Hear. Res. 28, 96-103 (1985); Uchanski et al., J. Speech Hear. Res. 39, 494-509 (1996); Payton, Uchanski, and Braida, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 1581-1592 (1994)]. However, it is unknown whether slower speaking rates are necessary for highly intelligible speech or whether an alternative form of clear speech exists at faster (i.e., normal) rates. To investigate this question, talkers with significant public speaking experience were asked to produce clear and conversational speech at slow, normal, and quick rates. A method for eliciting clear speech was introduced that ensured the clearest possible speech was obtained at each of these speaking rates. To probe for other highly intelligible speaking modes, talkers also recorded sentences in two other speaking modes: soft and loud. Intelligibility tests indicated that clear speech was the only speaking mode that provided a consistent intelligibility advantage over conversational speech. Moreover, the advantage of clear speech was extended to faster speaking rates than previously reported. These results suggest that clear speech has some inherent acoustic properties that contribute to its high intelligibility without altering rate. Identifying these acoustic properties could lead to improved signal-processing schemes for hearing aids.},

  abstract = {In adverse listening conditions, talkers can increase their intelligibility by speaking clearly [Picheny, M.A., et al. (1985). J. Speech Hear. Res. 28, 96–103; Payton, K. L., et al. (1994). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 1581–1592]. This modified speaking style, known as clear speech, is typically spoken more slowly than conversational speech [Picheny, M. A., et al. (1986). J. Speech Hear. Res. 29, 434–446; Uchanski, R. M., et al. (1996). J. Speech Hear. Res. 39, 494–509]. However, talkers can produce clear speech at normal rates (clear∕normal speech) with training [Krause, J. C., and Braida, L. D. (2002). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 112, 2165–2172] suggesting that clear speech has some inherent acoustic properties, independent of rate, that contribute to its improved intelligibility. Identifying these acoustic properties could lead to improved signal processing schemes for hearing aids. Two global-level properties of clear∕normal speech that appear likely to be associated with improved intelligibility are increased energy in the 1000–3000-Hz range of long-term spectra and increased modulation depth of low-frequency modulations of the intensity envelope [Krause, J. C., and Braida, L. D. (2004). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115, 362–378]. In an attempt to isolate the contributions of these two properties to intelligibility, signal processing transformations were developed to manipulate each of these aspects of conversational speech independently. Results of intelligibility testing with hearing-impaired listeners and normal-hearing listeners in noise suggest that (1) increasing energy between 1000 and 3000 Hz does not fully account for the intelligibility benefit of clear∕normal speech, and (2) simple filtering of the intensity envelope is generally detrimental to intelligibility. While other manipulations of the intensity envelope are required to determine conclusively the role of this factor in intelligibility, it is also likely that additional properties important for highly intelligible speech at normal speech at normal rates remain to be identified.},

Judgments of intelligibility for sentences produced at a habitual rate (Habitual condition) and at a faster-than-habitual rate (Fast condition) by 46 speakers with PD or MS as well as a group of 32 healthy speakers revealed that the Fast condition was, on average, associated with decreased intelligibility. However, some speakers' intelligibility did not decline. To further understand the acoustic characteristics of varied intelligibility in the Fast condition for speakers with dysarthria, a subgroup of speakers with PD or MS whose intelligibility did not decline in the Fast condition (no decline group, n=8) and a subgroup of speakers with significantly declined intelligibility (decline group, n=8) were compared. Acoustic measures of global speech timing, suprasegmental characteristics, and utterance-level segmental characteristics for vocalics were examined for the two subgroups. Results suggest acoustic contributions to intelligibility under rate modulation are complex. Potential clinical relevance and implications for the acoustic bases of intelligibility are discussed.},

  abstract = {Acoustic variation in a passage read by speakers with dysarthria and healthy speakers was examined. 15 speakers with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 12 speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 14 healthy speakers were studied. Acoustic variables included measures of global speech timing (e.g., articulation rate, pause characteristics), vocal intensity (e.g., mean sound pressure level and intensity modulation), and segmental articulation (i.e., utterance-level second formant interquartile range (F2 IQR)). Acoustic measures were obtained from three segments operationally defined to represent the beginning, middle, and end of a reading passage. Two speaking conditions associated with common treatment techniques for dysarthria were included for comparison to a habitual speaking condition. These conditions included a slower-than-habitual rate (Slow) and greater-than-habitual intensity (Loud). There was some degree of acoustic variation across the three operationally-defined segments of the reading passage. The Slow, Loud and Habitual conditions yielded comparable characteristics of variation. Patterns of acoustic variation across the three passage segments also were largely similar across speaker groups. Within-task acoustic variation during passage reading should be considered when making decisions regarding speech sampling in clinical practice and research. The contributions of speech disorder severity and linguistic variables to within-task acoustic change warrant further investigation. Readers will be able to (1) discuss the motivation for studying and understanding within-task variation in contextual speech, (2) describe patterns of acoustic variation for speakers with dysarthria and healthy speakers during passage reading, (3) discuss the relationship between non-habitual speaking conditions and within-task variation, (4) understand the need to consider within-speaker, within-task variation in speech sampling.},

  abstract = {Why do speakers of all languages use different grammatical structures under different communicative circumstances to express the same idea? Professor Lambrecht explores the relationship between the structure of the sentence and the linguistic and extra-linguistic context in which it is used. His analysis is based on the observation that the structure of a sentence reflects a speaker's assumption about the hearer's state of knowledge and consciousness at the time of the utterance. This relationship between speaker assumptions and formal sentence structure is governed by rules and conventions of grammar, in a component called 'information structure'. Four independent but interrelated categories are analysed: presupposition and assertion, identifiability and activation, topic, and focus.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess the effects of short- and long-term changes in auditory feedback on vowel and sibilant contrasts and to evaluate hypotheses arising from a model of speech motor planning. Method: The perception and production of vowel and sibilant contrasts were measured in 8 postlingually deafened adults prior to activation of their cochlear implant speech processors, 1 month postactivation, and 1 year postactivation. Measures were taken postactivation both with and without auditory feedback. Contrast measures were also made for a group of speakers with reportedly normal hearing speaking with masked and unmasked auditory feedback. Results: Vowel and sibilant contrasts, measured in the absence of auditory feedback after 1 month of prosthesis use, were diminished compared with their values measured before prosthesis. Contrasts measured in the absence of auditory feedback after 1 year ’s experience with the prosthesis were increased compared with their values after 1 month’s experience. In both time samples, contrasts were enhanced when auditory feedback was restored. Conclusion: The provision of prosthetic hearing to postlingually deafened adults impaired their phonemic contrasts at first, as their auditory feedback had novel characteristics. Once auditory feedback became recalibrated with prosthesis use, it could, in turn, revise feedforward commands that control the contrasts in its absence.},

METHODS: In an open-label cross-over randomised controlled trial, 15 healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) walked on a predefined city centre route in Beijing in the presence and absence of a highly efficient facemask. Personal exposure to ambient air pollution and exercise was assessed continuously using portable real-time monitors and global positional system tracking respectively. Cardiovascular effects were assessed by continuous 12-lead electrocardiographic and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Ambient exposure (PM2.5 86 +/- 61 vs 140 +/- 113 mug/m3; particle number 2.4 +/- 0.4 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4 x 104 particles/cm3), temperature (29 +/- 1 vs 28 +/- 3 degrees C) and relative humidity (63 +/- 10 vs 64 +/- 19\%) were similar (P {$>$} 0.05 for all) on both study days.

  abstract = {The purpose of this preliminary experiment was to evaluate the effect of a flattened fundamental frequency (F0) contour on sentence intelligibility. The perceptual dimension monotone pitch is frequently used to describe the speech of persons with dysarthria, and relatively flat F0 contours have been noted in several acoustic studies of dysarthria. To determine the independent effect of a flattened F0 contour on sentence intelligibility a resynthesis technique was used that held timing and spectral characteristics of utterances constant while allowing parametric control over successive pitch periods. Two male speakers produced low-probability utterances selected from the SPIN test, which were then resynthesized with a flattened F0 contour. Speech intelligibility was assessed using two measures: one involving word transcription and the other interval scaling. These measures were collected from 10 listeners. The results showed that both measures were significantly lower when the F0 contour was flattened, as compared with naturally varying contours. Several different explanations are proposed for this effect, which can and should be explored in greater detail using the resynthesis technique given the prominence of this characteristic in dysarthria.},

Acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel spaces were examined at the same time sampling point using electromagnetic articulography in 11 speakers with dysarthria secondary to ALS and 11 speakers without dysarthria. Tongue kinematic data were collected from the tongue body sensor (\textasciitilde{} 25 mm posterior from the tongue apex). A number of acoustic and tongue body kinematic variables were tested. The result showed that the acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel dispersion patterns are different between the groups. Acoustic and tongue body kinematic vowel spaces are highly correlated; however, unlike acoustic vowel space, tongue body kinematic vowel space was not significantly different between the groups. Both acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel dispersion patterns are sensitive to the group difference, especially with high vowels. The tongue kinematic vowel space approach is too crude to differentiate the speakers with dysarthria secondary to ALS from speakers without dysarthria. To examine tongue range of motion in speakers with dysarthria, a more refined articulatory kinematic approach needs to be examined in the future.}

Method               Twenty-three individuals with ALS and 22 typical individuals produced 10 monophthongs in an /h/-vowel-/d/ context. One hundred thirty-five listeners completed a forced-choice vowel identification test. Misidentified vowels were examined in terms of the target vowel categories (front–back; low–mid–high) and the direction of misidentification (the directional pattern when the target vowel was misidentified, e.g., misidentification “to a lower vowel”). In addition, acoustic predictors of vowel misidentifications were tested based on log first formant (F1), log second formant, log F1 vowel inherent spectral change, log second formant vowel inherent spectral change, and vowel duration.                                         Results               First, high and mid vowels were more frequently misidentified than low vowels for all speaker groups. Second, front and back vowels were misidentified at a similar rate for both the Mild and Severe groups, whereas back vowels were more frequently misidentified than front vowels in typical individuals. Regarding the direction of vowel misidentification, vowel errors were mostly made within the same backness (front–back) category for all groups.

  abstract = {Purpose               The current study examines the pattern of misidentified vowels produced by individuals with dysarthria secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).                                         Method               Twenty-three individuals with ALS and 22 typical individuals produced 10 monophthongs in an /h/-vowel-/d/ context. One hundred thirty-five listeners completed a forced-choice vowel identification test. Misidentified vowels were examined in terms of the target vowel categories (front–back; low–mid–high) and the direction of misidentification (the directional pattern when the target vowel was misidentified, e.g., misidentification “to a lower vowel”). In addition, acoustic predictors of vowel misidentifications were tested based on log first formant (F1), log second formant, log F1 vowel inherent spectral change, log second formant vowel inherent spectral change, and vowel duration.                                         Results               First, high and mid vowels were more frequently misidentified than low vowels for all speaker groups. Second, front and back vowels were misidentified at a similar rate for both the Mild and Severe groups, whereas back vowels were more frequently misidentified than front vowels in typical individuals. Regarding the direction of vowel misidentification, vowel errors were mostly made within the same backness (front–back) category for all groups. In addition, more errors were found toward a lower vowel category than toward a higher vowel category in the Severe group, but not in the Mild group. Overall, log F1 difference was identified as a consistent acoustic predictor of the main vowel misidentification pattern.                                         Conclusion               Frequent misidentifications in the vowel height dimension and the acoustic predictor, F1, suggest that limited tongue height control is the major articulatory dysfunction in individuals with ALS.

  abstract = {We evaluated acoustic voice characteristics of 18 male patients undergoing radiotherapy. The subjects were seen for voice assessment preradiotherapy and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following radiotherapy. A multidimensional voice analysis computer program (IVANS, Avaaz Innovations, 1998) was employed to evaluate measures of traditional frequency and amplitude perturbation as well as time-based and linear prediction (LP) modeled “noise” parameters of the acoustic output in conjunction with perceptual judgments of overall vocal quality. The results indicate vocal deterioration of vocal function immediately following radiotherapy with gradual and significant improvement in acoustic and perceptual features over 9 to 12 months following the radiation treatment. Measures of glottal noise demonstrated higher sensitivity than frequency-based measures of voice perturbation, and with more consistent, less variable changes in acoustical voice output from the preradiation to the 12 month postradiation periods. Future research evaluating vowel type and acoustic perturbation measures with a larger sample of subjects over a longer time period seems warranted.}

  abstract = {Using microspheres of human albumin sprayed on the face and in the nostrils under the facemask, we studied the role of conversation in contaminating the operating-room environment in addition to the microbial contamination of the air in an empty and in an occupied operating room. Conversation consistently increased the number of microspheres found in the simulated wound. The spatial relationship between the mask and the hood was important in reducing contamination. A complete hood overlapping the mask, with no gaps at the sides or bottom of the mask, was most efficient. The air contamination was increased by the presence of operating-room personnel and varied in different parts of the theater according to the density of traffic. We concluded that conversation contributes to airborne contamination in the operating theater but that contamination from this source can be lessened by wearing a face-mask that extends underneath an overlapping hood.},

In particular, in formation-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may inc lude maximizing the uni- formity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic r eduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control vari- ables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of using face masks to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

There were no language restrictions. This study was registered with PROSPERO under the number CRD42020211862. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included, involving 4 countries, after a total of 5,178 eligible articles were searched in databases and references. In general, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.38, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.69, I2 = 54.1\%). For the healthcare workers group, masks were shown to have a reduced risk of infection by nearly 70\%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that wearing a mask could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.

  abstract = {Speech samples were obtained that were analyzed for voice onset time (VOT) for 40 nondemented English speaking subjects, 20 with mild and 20 with moderate Parkinson's disease. Syntax comprehension and cognitive tests were administered to these subjects in the same test sessions. VOT disruptions for stop consonants in syllable initial position, similar to those noted for Broca's aphasia, occurred for nine subjects. Longer response times and errors in the comprehension of syntax as measured by the Rhode Island Test of Sentence Comprehension (RITLS) also occurred for these subjects. Anovas indicate that the VOT overlap subjects had significantly higher syntax error rates and longer response times on the RITLS than the VOT nonoverlap subjects–F(1, 70) = 12.38, p less than 0.0008; F(1, 70) = 7.70, p less than 0.007, respectively. The correlation between the number of VOT timing errors and the number of syntax errors was significant. (r = 0.6473, p less than 0.01). VOT overlap subjects also had significantly higher error rates in cognitive tasks involving abstraction and the ability to maintain a mental set. Prefrontal cortex, acting through subcortical basal ganglia pathways, is a component of the neural substrate that regulates human speech production, syntactic ability, and certain aspects of cognition. The deterioration of these subcortical pathways may explain similar phenomena in Broca's aphasia. Results are discussed in relation to “modular” theories.},

  abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to study relative contributions of speaking rate, temporal envelope, and temporal fine structure to clear speech perception. Experiment I used uniform time scaling to match the speaking rate between clear and conversational speech. Experiment II decreased the speaking rate in conversational speech without processing artifacts by increasing silent gaps between phonetic segments. Experiment III created “auditory chimeras” by mixing the temporal envelope of clear speech with the fine structure of conversational speech, and vice versa. Speech intelligibility in normal-hearing listeners was measured over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios to derive speech reception thresholds (SRT). The results showed that processing artifacts in uniform time scaling, particularly time compression, reduced speech intelligibility. Inserting gaps in conversational speech improved the SRT by 1.3 dB, but this improvement might be a result of increased short-term signal-to-noise ratios during level normalization. Data from auditory chimeras indicated that the temporal envelope cue contributed more to the clear speech advantage at high signal-to-noise ratios, whereas the temporal fine structure cue contributed more at low signal-to-noise ratios. Taken together, these results suggest that acoustic cues for the clear speech advantage are multiple and distributed.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the results of two experiments investigating the effects on speech acoustics and intelligibility of a number of different types of forensically-relevant fabric mouth and face coverings, including the niqāb (full-face Muslim veil), balaclava, and surgical mask. For the perceptual (intelligibility) experiment, subjects were presented with two types of speech stimuli, 'bimodal' and 'unimodal', and asked to write down what they heard. Four facial guises were used (niqāb, balaclava, surgical mask, no covering). In the bimodal condition (video + audio), subjects saw and heard video recordings of actors reading target words embedded in a standardised carrier sentence. In the unimodal (audio only) condition, subjects heard just the soundtrack of the same video recordings, i.e., no visual image was present. It was found in the perceptual test that the subjects could in all four guise conditions correctly identify target words with a high degree of reliability, and that a small number of confusion types accounted for the majority of the errors. For the second (acoustic) experiment, the objective was to assess the sound transmission loss characteristics of the fabrics from which these and other face coverings are composed. This experiment showed that transmission loss was negligible for all but one of the fabrics, suggesting that speech intelligibility problems created when mouth and face coverings are worn by speakers must derive principally from the reduction in visual information available to listeners and/or from the auditory consequences of interference with speech articulation caused by the face coverings, rather than from transmission loss of the fabrics themselves.},

Cooccurrence of symptoms in each patient was tabulated. Examination of the patterns of cooccurring dysfunctions permitted classifying the 200 patients into five groups: Group 1 (45\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction as their only vocal-tract symptom; Group 2 (13.5\% of the patients) with laryngeal and back-tongue involvement; Group 3 (17\% of the patients) with laryngeal, back-tongue, and tongue-blade dysfunction; Group 4 (5.5\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction, back-tongue involvement, tongue-blade dysfunction, and labial misarticulations; and Group 5 (9\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction and misarticulations of the back tongue, tongue blade, lips, and tongue tip. Disfluencies and hypernasality did not follow a systematic pattern of cooccurrence with other vocal-tract dysfunctions.},

The resulting “Lombard speech” is typically more intelligible than speech produced in quiet, even when level differences are removed. What is the cause of the enhanced intelligibility of Lombard speech? The current study explored the relative contributions to intelligibility of changes in mean F0 and spectral tilt. The roles of F0 and spectral tilt were assessed by measuring the intelligibility gain of non-Lombard speech whose mean F0 and spectrum were manipulated, both independently and in concert, to simulate those of natural Lombard speech. In the presence of speech-shaped noise, flattening of spectral tilt contributed greatly to the intelligibility gain of noise-induced speech over speech produced in quiet while an increase in F0 did not have a significant influence. The perceptual effects of spectrum flattening was attributed to its ability of increasing the amount of speech time–frequency plane “glimpsed” in the presence of noise. However, spectral tilt changes alone could not fully account for the intelligibility of Lombard speech. Other changes observed in Lombard speech such as durational modifications may well contribute to intelligibility.},

  abstract = {Health-related quality of life is a patient-reported outcome that complements clinical evaluation and provides information about disease activity and effects of the treatment. The objective of this review is to present the conceptual framework, the measures, and some of their most relevant applications in the field of Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. Health-related quality of life is a subjective, individual, and multidimensional construct, and its main dimensions are physical, mental, and social, besides global perceptions of health and personal domains. Health-related quality of life measurement is carried out by means of questionnaires or scales, ideally self-applied by patients, and has a diversity of important applications for clinical practice, research, and health policy. Movement disorders and Parkinson's disease are complex conditions impacting all components of patients' health-related quality of life. The use of health-related quality of life tools provides important information on a variety of aspects that are important to patients while complementing clinical evaluations. In particular, studies using this kind of assessment can identify and monitor the most important health-related quality of life determinant factors, allowing tailored assistance and prioritized interventions. In addition, maintaining or improving the patients' health-related quality of life is an objective of care for chronic diseases and, therefore, it has to be monitored over time and as an outcome of clinical trials. Several methods are available for the interpretation of the change in scores of health-related quality of life measures, although a definitive agreement on the most appropriate method is yet to be determined. Presently, health-related quality of life assessment is an important outcome for research and management of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide use of nose-and-mouth-covering respiratory protective mask (RPM) has become ubiquitous during COVID19 pandemic. Consequences of wearing RPMs, especially regarding perception and production of spoken communication, are gradually emerging. The present study explored how three prevalent RPMs affect various speech and voice sound properties. METHODS: Pre-recorded sustained [a] vowels and read sentences from 47 subjects were played by a speech production model ('Voice Emitted by Spare Parts', or 'VESPA') in four conditions: without RPM (C1), with disposable surgical mask (C2), with FFP2 mask (C3), and with transparent plastic mask (C4). Differences between C1 and masked conditions were assessed with Dunnett's t test in 26 speech sound properties related to voice production (fundamental frequency, sound intensity level), voice quality (jitter percent, shimmer percent, harmonics-to-noise ratio, smoothed cepstral peak prominence, Acoustic Voice Quality Index), articulation and resonance (first and second formant frequencies, first and second formant bandwidths, spectral center of gravity, spectral standard deviation, spectral skewness, spectral kurtosis, spectral slope, and spectral energy in ten 1-kHz bands from 0 to 10 kHz). RESULTS: C2, C3, and C4 significantly affected 10, 15, and 19 of the acoustic speech markers, respectively. Furthermore, absolute differences between unmasked and masked conditions were largest for C4 and smallest for C2. CONCLUSIONS: All RPMs influenced more or less speech sound properties. However, this influence was least for surgical RPMs and most for plastic RPMs. Surgical RPMs are therefore preferred when spoken communication is priority next to respiratory protection.},

One hundred and sixty children participated. Half were evacuated from home with the help of their parents, whereas the other half were evacuated from day-care centres with the help of staff. In all, 65\% of the children were evacuated wearing their RPDs. No significant differences were found between the two environments, but significantly more children (75\%) kept the mask on than the jacket (55\%). However, many more cases of improper fit after dressing were observed with the mask than with the jacket. Speech communication was observed to be reduced for 58\% of the children, wearing the mask, and slightly more for those wearing the jacket. Children who did not evacuate with the RPDs on were observed to be more anxious and adults' attitudes towards them were rated as more neutral, whereas children who successfully evacuated were less anxious and adults' attitudes towards them were rated both as more positive and as more negative.},

  abstract = {Airflow during speech production is recorded using a pneumotachograph system wherein typically a mask is placed upon the face. Accurate measures of airflow require mask calibration and a complete seal of the mask rim to the face. Literature frequently cites mask rim leaks as causing flow measurement inaccuracies, but quantitative studies of the inaccuracies are needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of inaccuracy of flow measurement using a Glottal Enterprises aerodynamic system for a variety of mask rim leak conditions. Air was pushed and pulled through the Glottal Enterprises mask system over a wide range of airflow with leaks simulated by small metal tubes of various cross-sectional areas placed between the mask rim and a face-like calibration mold. Two leak locations, single versus multiple leaks, and two different leak tube geometries were used. Results suggest that (1) as leak area increases, the amount of leak flow increases; (2) the amount of flow leak is relatively independent of location; (3) given equivalent leak areas, multiple leak locations provide less leak flow; and (4) quasi-elliptical tubes were more resistive to airflow than rectangular tubes. A general empirical equation was obtained that relates the leak flow between the mask rim and the face, the size of the leak region, and the amount of the upstream airflow toward the mask: Leak(cm(3)/s) = 0.33 × Area(cm(2)) × Flow(cm(3)/s) for the range of ±2000 cm(3)/s. This equation may provide researchers and clinicians with a tool for generalizing airflow leak effects.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that consonant imprecision in Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from a reduction in amplitude of lingual movements or articulatory undershoot. While this has been postulated, direct measurement of the tongue's contact with the hard palate during speech production has not been undertaken. Therefore, the present study aimed to use electropalatography (EPG) to determine the exact nature of tongue-palate contact in a group of individuals with PD and consonant imprecision (n = 9). Furthermore, the current investigation also aimed to compare the results of the participants with PD to a group of aged (n = 7) and young (n = 8) control speakers to determine the relative contribution of ageing of the lingual musculature to any articulatory deficits noted. Participants were required to read aloud the phrase 'I saw a \_ today' with the artificial palate in-situ. Target words included the consonants /l/, /s/ and /t/ in initial position in both the /i/ and /a/ vowel environments. Phonetic transcription of phoneme productions and description of error types was completed. Furthermore, representative frames of contact were employed to describe the features of tongue-palate contact and to calculate spatial palatal indices. Results of the perceptual investigation revealed that perceived undershooting of articulatory targets distinguished the participant group with PD from the control groups. However, objective EPG assessment indicated that undershooting of the target consonant was not the cause of the perceived articulatory errors. It is, therefore, possible that reduced pressure of tongue contact with the hard palate, sub-lingual deficits or impaired articulatory timing resulted in the perceived undershooting of the target consonants.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations employing electropalatography (EPG) have identified articulatory timing deficits in individuals with acquired dysarthria. However, this technology is yet to be applied to the articulatory timing disturbance present in Parkinson's disease (PD). As a result, the current investigation aimed to use EPG to comprehensively examine the temporal aspects of articulation in a group of nine individuals with PD at sentence, word and segment level. This investigation followed on from a prior study (McAuliffe, Ward and Murdoch) and similarly, aimed to compare the results of the participants with PD to a group of aged (n = 7) and young controls (n = 8) to determine if ageing contributed to any articulatory timing deficits observed. Participants were required to read aloud the phrase “I saw a \_ today” with the EPG palate in-situ. Target words included the consonants /l/, /s/ and /t/ in initial position in both the /i/ and /a/ vowel environments. Perceptual investigation of speech rate was conducted in addition to objective measurement of sentence, word and segment duration. Segment durations included the total segment length and duration of the approach, closure/constriction and release phases of EPG consonant production. Results of the present study revealed impaired speech rate, perceptually, in the group with PD. However, this was not confirmed objectively. Electropalatographic investigation of segment durations indicated that, in general, the group with PD demonstrated segment durations consistent with the control groups. Only one significant difference was noted, with the group with PD exhibiting significantly increased duration of the release phase for /la/ when compared to both the control groups. It is, therefore, possible that EPG failed to detect lingual movement impairment as it does not measure the complete tongue movement towards and away from the hard palate. Furthermore, the contribution of individual variation to the present findings should not be overlooked.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The aim of this study was to examine the effect of loud and slow speech cues on younger and older listeners' comprehension of dysarthric speech, specifically, (a) whether one strategy, as opposed to the other, promoted greater intelligibility gains for different speaker groups; (b) whether older and younger listeners' understandings were differentially affected by these strategies; and (c) which acoustic changes best predicted intelligibility gain in individual speakers.                                         Method               Twenty younger and 40 older listeners completed a perceptual task. Six individuals with dysarthria produced phrases across habitual, loud, and slow conditions. The primary dependent variable was proportion of words correct; follow-up acoustic analyses linked perceptual outcomes to changes in acoustic speech features.                                         Results               Regardless of dysarthria type, the loud condition produced significant intelligibility gains. Overall, older listeners' comprehension was reduced relative to younger listeners. Follow-up analysis revealed considerable interspeaker differences in intelligibility outcomes across conditions. Although the most successful speaking mode varied, intelligibility gains were strongly associated with the degree of change participants made to their vowel formants.                                         Conclusions               Perceptual outcomes vary across speaking modes, even when speakers with dysarthria are grouped according to similar perceptual profiles. Further investigation of interspeaker differences is needed to inform individually tailored intervention approaches.},

  abstract = {Purpose               This study examined vocal hyperfunction (VH) using voice onset time (VOT). We hypothesized that speakers with VH would produce shorter VOTs, indicating increased laryngeal tension, and more variable VOTs, indicating disordered vocal motor control.                                         Method               We enrolled 32 adult women with VH (aged 20–74 years) and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. All were speakers of American English. Participants produced vowel–consonant–vowel combinations that varied by vowel (ɑ/u) and plosive (p/b, t/d, k/g). VOT—measured at the release of the plosive to the initiation of voicing—was averaged over three repetitions of each vowel–consonant–vowel combination. The coefficient of variation (CoV), a measure of VOT variability, was also computed for each combination.                                         Results                                The mean VOTs were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the CoVs were significantly greater in speakers with VH compared to controls. Voiceless CoV values were moderately correlated with clinical ratings of dysphonia (                 r                 = .58) in speakers with VH.                                                        Conclusion               Speakers with VH exhibited greater variability in phonemic voicing targets compared to vocally healthy speakers, supporting the hypothesis for disordered vocal motor control in VH. We suggest future work incorporate VOT measures when assessing auditory discrimination and auditory–motor integration deficits in VH.},

  abstract = {This study sought to characterize the relationship among voluntary rate modification, vocal tract acoustic output, and perceptual impressions of speech for individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). Healthy control speakers were studied for comparison purposes. Four research questions were addressed: (1) How is rate modification evidenced in acoustic measures of segmental and global timing? (2) What is the impact of rate modification on measures of acoustic working space for select vowels and consonants? (3) What is the impact of rate modification on perceptual impressions of severity? (4) Are rate-induced changes in measures of acoustic working space related to perceptual impressions of severity? Speakers read the Farm Passage at habitual, slow, and fast rates. The vowels /i/, /ae/, /u/, and /A/ and the fricatives /s/ and /S/ were of interest. Acoustic measures included articulatory rate, segment durations, vowel formant frequencies, and first moment coefficients. Measures of acoustic working space for vowels and fricatives also were derived. The results indicated that temporal acoustic measures changed in the expected direction across rate conditions, with a tendency toward slightly faster rates for the PD group. In addition, the relative rate change for the Fast and Slow conditions compared to the Habitual condition was similar across groups. Rate did not strongly affect measures of acoustic working space for the PD group as a whole, but there was a tendency for slower rates to be associated with larger measures of acoustic working space. Finally, there was not a strong relationship between perceived severity and measures of acoustic working space across the rate continuum for either group. Rather, the relationship between perceived severity and measures of acoustic working space was such that the PD group exhibited smaller measures of acoustic working space and more severe perceptual estimates than the control speakers, irrespective of rate condition.},

Method                                Seventeen talkers with mild–moderate dysarthria due to PD and 17 controls completed a sentence repetition task using typical, slow, loud, and clear speech. Tongue and jaw articulatory movements were recorded using 3D electromagnetic articulography. Independent tongue displacements, jaw displacements, and acoustic vowel contrast were calculated for the diphthong /aɪ/ embedded in the word                 kite.                                                        Results               During typical speech, independent tongue displacement, but not jaw displacement, contributed significantly to the intertalker variance in acoustic vowel contrast. Loudness-related acoustic vowel contrast gains were predominantly jaw driven in controls but driven by the tongue and jaw in talkers with PD. Further, in both groups, clarity-related acoustic vowel contrast gains were predominantly jaw driven. Finally, in both groups, rate-related acoustic vowel contrast gains were predominantly tongue driven; however, the jaw also contributed. These jaw contributions were greater in the PD group than in the control group.                                         Conclusions               Findings suggest that a tongue-specific articulatory impairment underlies acoustic vowel contrast deterioration in talkers with PD, at least during the early stages of speech decline. Findings further suggest that slow speech engages the impaired tongue more than loud and clear speech in talkers with PD. However, slow speech was also associated with an abnormally strong jaw response in these talkers, which suggests that a compensatory articulatory behavior may also be elicited.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a surgical mask had an effect on speech understanding for listeners with normal hearing and hearing impairment when speech stimuli were administered in the presence or absence of dental office noise. RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were assigned to one of two groups based on hearing sensitivity in this quasi-experimental, cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 31 adults participated in this study (1 talker, 15 listeners with normal hearing, and 15 with hearing impairment). The normal hearing group had thresholds of 25 dB HL or better at the octave frequencies from 250 through 8000 Hz while the hearing loss group had varying degrees and configurations of hearing loss with thresholds equal to or poorer than 25 dB HL for the same octave frequencies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Selected lists from the Connected Speech Test (CST) were digitally recorded with and without a surgical mask present and then presented to the listeners in four conditions: without a mask in quiet, without a mask in noise, with a mask in quiet, and with a mask in noise. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the spectral analyses of the speech stimuli with and without the mask. The presence of a surgical mask, however, did not have a detrimental effect on speech understanding in either the normal-hearing or hearing-impaired groups. The dental office noise did have a significant effect on speech understanding for both groups.

Extended speech samples were used. The recorded readings of a text by 31 women and by 24 men were analyzed by means of the Long-Term Spectrum (LTAS), extracting the amplitude values (in decibels) at intervals of 160 Hz over a range of 8 kHz. The results showed a significant difference between genders, as well as an interaction of gender and frequency level. The female voice showed greater levels of aspiration noise, located in the spectral regions corresponding to the third formant, which causes the female voice to have a more "breathy" quality than the male voice. The lower spectral tilt in the women's voices is another consequence of this presence of greater aspiration noise.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have documented that speech with flattened or inverted fundamental frequency (F0) contours is less intelligible than speech with natural variations in F0. The purpose of this present study was to further investigate how F0 manipulations affect speech intelligibility in background noise. Speech recognition in noise was measured for sentences having the following F0 contours: unmodified, flattened at the median, natural but exaggerated, inverted, and sinusoidally frequency modulated at rates of 2.5 and 5.0 Hz, rates shown to make vowels more perceptually salient in background noise. Five talkers produced 180 stimulus sentences, with 30 unique sentences per F0 contour condition. Flattening or exaggerating the F0 contour reduced key word recognition performance by 13\% relative to the naturally produced speech. Inverting or sinusoidally frequency modulating the F0 contour reduced performance by 23\% relative to typically produced speech. These results support the notion that linguistically incorrect or misleading cues have a greater deleterious effect on speech understanding than linguistically neutral cues.},

  abstract = {Improvement or maintenance of speech intelligibility is a central aim in a whole range of conditions in speech-language therapy, both developmental and acquired. Best clinical practice and pursuance of the evidence base for interventions would suggest measurement of intelligibility forms a vital role in clinical decision-making and monitoring. However, what should be measured to gauge intelligibility and how this is achieved and relates to clinical planning continues to be a topic of debate. This review considers the strengths and weaknesses of selected clinical approaches to intelligibility assessment, stressing the importance of explanatory, diagnostic testing as both a more sensitive and a clinically informative method. The worth of this, and any approach, is predicated, though, on awareness and control of key design, elicitation, transcription and listening/listener variables to maximize validity and reliability of assessments. These are discussed. A distinction is drawn between signal-dependent and -independent factors in intelligibility evaluation. Discussion broaches how these different perspectives might be reconciled to deliver comprehensive insights into intelligibility levels and their clinical/educational significance. The paper ends with a call for wider implementation of best practice around intelligibility assessment.},

This noise can be reduced with motorcycle helmets. In this study, insertion loss of motorcycle helmets was measured with the microphone-in-real-ear technique and sound attenuation with the real-ear-at-threshold method. Results for 3 Nolan helmets show essentially no protection against external noise in the frequency range {$<$}250 Hz. In the frequency range {$>$}500 Hz, attenuation increases linearly at a rate of 8-9 dB per octave, to 30 dB at 8 kHz. Lack of attenuation in the low-frequency range may cause annoying effects. In addition, high attenuation in the high-frequency range may decrease intelligibility of speech signals for a rider in a helmet. Attenuation measured in this study does not take into account noise generated by turbulent wind around the helmet. Thus, the measured values of attenuation represent a motorcycle rider's best conditions of hearing.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Speech-language pathologists may introduce augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) systems to people who are unable to use speech for everyday communication. Despite the benefits of AAC systems, they are significantly underutilized by the people with complex communication needs. The current review aimed to synthesize the barriers and facilitators to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems. Materials and methods: Relevant literature was identified via a systematic search strategy. Included articles (n = 43) were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Qualitative framework analysis was then completed with reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Results and conclusion: Most barriers and facilitators were coded as contextual factors within the ICF. Of most prominence were environmental factors, including attitudes of and supports provided by professionals, family members, and the society at large. Themes were also identified which related to the personal factors, including the user’s own attitude, socioeconomic status, and culture. Beyond these contextual factors, the remaining codes related to body functions such as cognition and movement. There are numerous barriers to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems, which may contribute to the inadequate use of these systems by people with complex communication needs. Suggestions for reducing these barriers are presented with regards to the person with complex communication needs, their family, and the professionals involved in their care.Implications for RehabilitationAAC systems can reduce participation restrictions for people with complex communication needs.The provision and use of AAC systems is influenced by environmental factors, personal factors, and features of a person’s body function.SLPs may need to collaborate with a large multidisciplinary team to successfully introduce AAC systems.SLP, teaching, and nursing students require theoretical and practical experience in AAC throughout their training to enable the provision and use of these systems.},

  abstract = {To assess a phonological theory, we often compare its predictions to phonetic observations. This can be complicated, however, because it requires a theoretical model that maps from phonological representations to articulatory and acoustic observations. In this study we are concerned with the question of how phonetic observations are interpreted in relation to phonological theories. Specifically, we argue that deviations of observations from theoretical predictions do not necessitate the rejection of the theoretical assumptions. We critically discuss the problem of overinterpretation of phonetic measures by using syllable coordination for different speaker groups within Articulatory Phonology. It is shown that surface variation can be explained without necessitating substantial revision of the underlying phonological theory. These results are discussed with respect to two types of interpretational errors in the literature. The first involves the proliferation of phonological categories in order to accommodate variation, and the second the rejection of a phonological theory because the model which generates its predictions is overly simplified.},

This is due to the fact that spontaneous speech and read speech are significantly different acoustically as well as linguistically. This paper statistically and quantitatively analyzes differences in acoustic features between spontaneous and read speech using two large-scale speech corpora, “Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ)” and “Japanese Newspaper Article Sentences (JNAS)”. Experimental results show that spontaneous speech can be characterized by reduced spectral space in comparison with that of read speech, and that the more spontaneous, the more the spectral space shrinks. This paper also clarifies that reduction in the spectral space leads to reduction in phoneme recognition accuracy. This result indicates that spectral reduction is one major reason for the decrease of recognition accuracy in spontaneous speech.},

This tutorial introduces Bayesian multilevel modeling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R. Method: In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modeling by reanalyzing a phonetic data set containing formant (F1 and F2) values for 5 vowels of standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken by 8 speakers (4 females and 4 males), with several repetitions of each vowel. Results: We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions: Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement  study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec,  Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English,  and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. EXPOSURES: All  participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear  communication device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Speech intelligibility was  measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence  recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0\% to 100\%) was  obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using  the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low  workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 12  participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7\%]). AzBio  Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD)  speech intelligibility was 98.8\% (1.8\%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3\% (7.4\%)  with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech  intelligibility was 58.5\% (12.4\%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8\% (8.9\%) with the  device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6\% (9.8\%)  without the in-ear device vs 94.5\% (5.5\%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device  was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while  wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3\%; 95\% CI, 23.8\%-40.7\%; P\,{$<$}\,.001)  and the PAPR (9.9\%; 95\% CI, 1.4\%-18.3\%; P\,=\,.01). Furthermore, use of the device was  associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal  that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6  (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While  wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was  67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear  device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2)  points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use  of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload  score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95\% CI, 23.5-53.3;  P\,{$<$}\,.001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95\% CI, 0.4-36.4; P\,=\,.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired  communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and  decreased listening effort. Such a device may be a feasible solution for protecting  health care workers in the operating room while allowing them to communicate safely,  especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

In the  present study, we compared acoustic voice measures in recordings of sixteen adults  producing standardised vocal tasks with and without wearing either a surgical mask  or a KN95 mask. Data were analysed for mean spectral levels at 0-1~kHz and 1-8~kHz  regions, an energy ratio between 0-1 and 1-8~kHz (LH1000), harmonics-to-noise ratio  (HNR), smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS), and vocal intensity. In connected  speech there was significant attenuation of mean spectral level at 1-8~kHz region  and there was no significant change in this measure at 0-1~kHz. Mean spectral levels  of vowel did not change significantly in mask-wearing conditions. LH1000 for  connected speech significantly increased whilst wearing either a surgical mask or  KN95 mask but no significant change in this measure was found for vowel. HNR was  higher in the mask-wearing conditions than the no-mask condition. CPPS and vocal  intensity did not change in mask-wearing conditions. These findings implied an  attenuation effects of wearing these types of masks on the voice spectra with  surgical mask showing less impact than the KN95.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of SARS in 2003 had a dramatic effect on the health care system in Toronto. The main objective of this study was to investigate the psychosocial effects associated with working in a hospital environment during this outbreak. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to all willing employees of Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre between Apr. 10 and 22, 2003. The survey included questions regarding concern about SARS, precautionary measures, personal well-being and sociodemographic characteristics; a subsample also received the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). RESULTS: Of the 4283 questionnaires distributed, 2001 (47\%) were returned, representing 27\% of the total hospital employee population of 7474. The proportions of respondents who were allied health care professionals, nurses and doctors and who worked in areas other than patient care were representative of the hospital staff population as a whole. Of the 2001 questionnaires, 510 contained the GHQ-12. Two-thirds of the respondents reported SARS-related concern for their own or their family's health. A total of 148 respondents (29\%) scored above the threshold point on the GHQ-12, indicating probable emotional distress; the rate among nurses was 45\%. Masks were reported to be the most bothersome infection control precaution. Logistic regression analysis identified 4 factors as being significantly associated with increased levels of concern for personal or family health: perception of a greater risk of death from SARS (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.0, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-9.6), living with children (adjusted OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.5-2.3), personal or family lifestyle affected by SARS outbreak (adjusted OR 3.3, 95\% CI 2.5-4.3) and being treated differently by people because of working in a hospital (adjusted OR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2-2.1). Four factors were identified as being significantly associated with the presence of emotional distress: being a nurse (adjusted OR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.5-5.5), part-time employment status (adjusted OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.2-5.4), lifestyle affected by SARS outbreak (adjusted OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.4-3.5) and ability to do one's job affected by the precautionary measures (adjusted OR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.9-4.6). INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the SARS outbreak had significant psychosocial effects on hospital staff. These effects differed with respect to occupation and risk perception. The effect on families and lifestyle was also substantial. These findings highlight the need for interventions to address psychosocial distress and concern and to provide support for employees during such crises.},

This study aimed to investigate the effects of levodopa on isolated vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease, excluding speech fluctuations caused by dyskinesia. 21 patients (14 males and 7 females) and 21 age- and sex- matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Together with motor assessment, the patients phonated five Japanese isolated vowels (/a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/) 20 times before and 1 h after levodopa treatment. We made the frequency analysis of each vowel and measured the first and second formants. From these formants we constructed the pentagonal vowel space area which should be the good indicator for articulatory dysfunction of vowels. In control subjects, only speech samples were analyzed. To investigate the sequential relationship between plasma levodopa concentrations, motor performances, and acoustic measurements after treatment, entire drug cycle tests were performed in 4 patients. The pentagonal vowel space area was significantly expanded together with motor amelioration after levodopa treatment, although the enlargement is not enough for the space area of control subjects. Drug cycle tests revealed that sequential increases or decreases in plasma levodopa levels after treatment correlated well with expansion or decrease of the vowel space areas and improvement or deterioration of motor manifestations. Levodopa expanded the vowel space area and ameliorated motor performance, suggesting that dysfunctions in vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease are based on dopaminergic pathology.}

  abstract = {Purpose               We present a tripartite view of intelligibility in which the contributions of both the speaker and listener, as well as their joint effort during interaction, are considered. While considerable research has examined communicative interactions in situ, there is a critical gap in current knowledge on how speech intelligibility unfolds during such interactions. Here, we argue that research examining speech intelligibility in communicative interactions may provide important groundwork for advancement in clinical interventions for individuals with dysarthria.                                         Method               First, we describe the view and argue for its consideration as a powerful way of thinking about speech intelligibility. We then briefly situate the view in the relevant literature on speech intelligibility and existing theoretical frameworks. We then identify suitable methodological paradigms for studying joint contributions to intelligibility and, lastly, discuss the clinical application and potential impact of this tripartite view.                                         Conclusions               Speech communication occurs through interaction; however, in the laboratory and clinic, emphasis is usually placed on individual speakers and listeners. We have proposed that it is critical to consider how the joint contributions of speakers and listeners affect speech intelligibility in communicative interaction. This conceptualization is well aligned with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and the findings from such an approach will allow us to better understand how to maximize available resources to enhance speech intelligibility.                        ,},

  abstract = {Wearing a face mask has been accepted as one of the most effective ways for slowing the spread of COVID-19. Yet information regarding the degree to which masks affect acoustics and perception associated with voice performers is scarce. This study examines these effects with common face masks, namely a neck gaiter, disposable surgical mask, and N95 mask, as well as a novel material that could be used as a mask (acoustic foam). A recorded excerpt from the "Star-Spangled Banner" was played through a miniature speaker placed inside the mouth of a masked manikin. Experienced listeners were asked to rate perceptual qualities of these singing stimuli by blindly comparing them with the same recording captured without a mask. Acoustic analysis showed that face masks affected the sound by enhancing or suppressing different frequency bands compared to no mask. Acoustic energy around the singer's formant was reduced when using surgical and N95 masks, which matches observations that these masks are more detrimental to the perceptions of singing voice compared with neck gaiter or acoustic foam. It suggests that singers can benefit from masks designed for minimal impact on auditory perception of the singing voice while maintaining reasonable efficacy of filtering efficiency.},

In each interval of one semitone and one decibel, narrowband spectra were averaged both within and across subjects. The subjects were groups of 7 male and 12 female singing students, as well as a group of 16 untrained female voices. For each individual and also for each group, pairs of VRP recordings were made, with stringent separation of the modal/chest and falsetto/head registers. Maps are presented of eight scalar metrics, each of which was chosen to quantify a particular feature of the voice spectrum, over fundamental frequency and SPL. Metrics 1 and 2 chart the role of the fundamental in relation to the rest of the spectrum. Metrics 3 and 4 are used to explore the role of resonances in relation to SPL. Metrics 5 and 6 address the distribution of high frequency energy, while metrics 7 and 8 seek to describe the distribution of energy at the low end of the voice spectrum.},

  abstract = {When auditory feedback is perturbed in a consistent way, speakers learn to adjust their speech to compensate, a process known as sensorimotor adaptation. Although this paradigm has been highly informative for our understanding of the role of sensory feedback in speech motor control, its ability to induce behaviorally relevant changes in speech that affect communication effectiveness remains unclear. Because reduced vowel contrast contributes to intelligibility deficits in many neurogenic speech disorders, we examine human speakers’ ability to adapt to a nonuniform perturbation field that was designed to affect vowel distinctiveness, applying a shift that depended on the vowel being produced. Twenty-five participants were exposed to this “vowel centralization” feedback perturbation in which the first two formant frequencies were shifted toward the center of each participant’s vowel space, making vowels less distinct from one another. Speakers adapted to this nonuniform shift, learning to produce corner vowels with increased vowel space area and vowel contrast to partially overcome the perceived centralization. The increase in vowel contrast occurred without a concomitant increase in duration and persisted after the feedback shift was removed, including after a 10-min silent period. These findings establish the validity of a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to increase vowel contrast, showing that complex, nonuniform alterations to sensory feedback can successfully drive changes relevant to intelligible communication.},

Objective speech quality measures, including the auditory distance parameter based on the measuring normalizing blocks technique, and the perceptual speech quality measure, and subjective impressions of speech coder performance were used to assess the interaction between speech coder and speech disorder. Objective speech quality measures revealed that the performance of the LD-CELP and GSM RPE-LTP coders was not measurably influenced by the type of input speech, and that MELP, FS1015 LPC and to a certain extent FS1016 CELP exhibited degraded performance with speech samples from disordered talkers. Results from perceptual experiments were in contrast with the objective measures of speech quality; ratings of speech coder performance indicated that the listeners are less sensitive to coder-induced distortions with abnormal speech samples.}

Multiple bursts (MBs) on the same stop consonant have been reported previously in some motor speech disorders, but no studies are known to have examined MBs in individuals with PD. The current study looked at the occurrences of bursts and MBs in initial stop consonants produced by nine individuals with PD (ON and OFF medication) and nine control speakers. Individuals with PD produced fewer overall bursts compared to control participants. In terms of place of articulation, individuals with PD primarily had loss of bursts in bilabial stops. In addition, individuals with PD had more MBs than control speakers, primarily in alveolars. Finally, no dopamine-related medication effects were found for occurrences of bursts or MBs in individuals with PD. Overall, the study provided evidence for loss of bursts and presence of MBs for stop consonants produced by individuals with PD.},

  abstract = {Exaggerated and redundant prosodic cue use has been noted among adults with dysarthria secondary to cerebral palsy (CP) (; ). A possible explanation may be that speakers heighten prosodic contrasts to increase intelligibility. The current work examined whether children with dysarthria due to CP also produce exaggerated prosodic contours and if so, how prosodic cue use in these speakers impacts intelligibility. Acoustic analyses were conducted on a previously collected dataset of 2-7 word utterances produced by fourteen children with CP (7 with dysarthria and 7 without) (). The dataset also included sentence-level transcriptions obtained from five listeners per speaker. Word intelligibility scores were derived from these transcripts and used to determine whether prosodic modulation differed for words with high versus low intelligibility. Although mean fundamental frequency (F0) and intensity range were similar across groups, words produced by children with dysarthria were slower and more variable in F0 than the group without dysarthria. Moreover, intelligibility decreased when children with dysarthria increased F0 and duration beyond the range used by children without dysarthria. Thus findings suggest that interventions targeting appropriate prosody may be beneficial in improving intelligibility in children with dysarthria and CP.},

  abstract = {Objective: We investigated the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Olmsted County, MN, using in-person evaluations and published criteria. Methods: We evaluated an age- and sex-stratified random sample of Olmsted County residents who were 70–89 years old on October 1, 2004, using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, a neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological testing to assess 4 cognitive domains: memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial skills. Information for each participant was reviewed by an adjudication panel and a diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia was made using published criteria. Results: Among 1,969 subjects without dementia, 329 subjects had MCI, with a prevalence of 16.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 14.4–17.5) for any MCI, 11.1\% (95\% CI 9.8–12.3) for amnestic MCI, and 4.9\% (95\% CI 4.0–5.8) for nonamnestic MCI. The prevalence of MCI increased with age and was higher in men. The prevalence odds ratio (OR) in men was 1.54 (95\% CI 1.21–1.96; adjusted for age, education, and nonparticipation). The prevalence was also higher in subjects who never married and in subjects with an APOE ε3ε4 or ε4ε4 genotype. MCI prevalence decreased with increasing number of years of education (p for linear trend {$<$}0.0001). Conclusions: Our study suggests that approximately 16\% of elderly subjects free of dementia are affected by MCI, and amnestic MCI is the most common type. The higher prevalence of MCI in men may suggest that women transition from normal cognition directly to dementia at a later age but more abruptly.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: As individuals age, the quality of cognitive function becomes an increasingly important topic. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has evolved over the past 2 decades to represent a state of cognitive function between that seen in normal aging and dementia. As such, it is important for health care providers to be aware of the condition and place it in the appropriate clinical context., Recent Findings: Numerous international population-based studies have been conducted to document the frequency of MCI, estimating its prevalence to be between 15\% and 20\% in persons 60 years and older, making it a common condition encountered by clinicians. The annual rate in which MCI progresses to dementia varies between 8\% and 15\% per year, implying that it is an important condition to identify and treat. In those MCI cases destined to develop Alzheimer disease, biomarkers are emerging to help identify etiology and predict progression. However, not all MCI is due to Alzheimer disease, and identifying subtypes is important for possible treatment and counseling. If treatable causes are identified, the person with MCI might improve., Summary: MCI is an important clinical entity to identify, and while uncertainties persist, clinicians need to be aware of its diagnostic features to enable them to counsel patients. MCI remains an active area of research as numerous randomized controlled trials are being conducted to develop effective treatments.},

Selection was based on a definite diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and adequate intelligence, hearing, and ability to perform the required tasks. Two estimates of speech intelligibility were obtained from naive listeners: single words correctly recognized and prose intelligibility rating. Diadochokinetic (DDK) syllable rates and percent correct articulation of selected phonemes were employed as indices of articulatory impairment. The 50 subjects were, on average, judged to be 50\% intelligible on both intelligibility estimates. Group mean DDK rate was 2.9 syllables per second and 78\% of phonemes were transcribed as correctly articulated. :The mean scores of the spastic subjects were superior to the athetoids on all speech measures, significantly so for single-word intelligibility and DDK rate even when group inequalities for physical disability and I.Q. were adjusted. In this sample, spastics were less physically disabled and had lower I.Q.'s than athetoids. Specific phonemic features characteristic of the dysarthria in cerebral-palsied subjects were: (1) anterior lingual place inaccuracy; (2) reduced precision of fricative and affricate manners; and (3) inability to achieve the extreme positions in the vowel articulatory space. A comparison of these results with those reported for children with cerebral palsy suggests that the consonantal place and manner problems are fairly stable features of cerebral palsy dysarthria.},

Phonetic transcriptions were made of single-word utterances which contained 49 selected phonemes: 22 word-initial consonants, 18 word-final consonants and nine vowels. Errors of substitution, omission and distortion were categorized on confusion matrices such that patterns could be observed. It was found that within-manner errors (place or voicing errors or both) exceeded between-manner errors by a substantial amount, more so on final consonants. The predominant within-manner errors occurred on fricative phonemes for both initial and final positions. Affricate within-manner errors, all of devoicing, were also frequent in final position. The predominant between-manner initial position errors involved liquid-to-glide and affricate-to-stop changes, and for final position, affricate-to-fricative. Phoneme omission occurred three times more frequently on final than on initial consonants. The error data of individual subjects were found to correspond with the identified overall group patterns. Those with markedly reduced speech intelligibility demonstrated the same patterns of error as the overall group. The implications for treatment are discussed.},

Six animals were trained to maintain a static force for a 2-sec period, and two animals were trained to make a rapid series of bites on a force transducer four times in succession. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were chronically implanted into temporalis and masseter muscles. Lesions were made in the cerebellum in seven monkeys and a control surgery with no neural damage was performed on one monkey. Following cerebellar lesions, the abilities of the monkeys to maintain a static isometric force for 2 sec were impaired. Animals overshot the correct force band and force tremors increased in amplitude following the lesions. Cerebellar lesions were followed also by a reduction in biting frequency from about 3 Hz to 2 Hz. Measurements of the temporalis EMG indicated that the reduced biting rate was associated primarily with a prolongation of the inter-EMG interval and secondarily with a prolongation of the EMG duration. Changes in jaw-force regulation following the lesions appear to be similar to the types of changes observed in arm control in monkeys, and in the speech of persons with ataxic dysarthria.},

We analyzed the CTG repeat region of the SCA8 gene in a series of Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia. We also investigated the frequency of the CTG repeat length in Japanese normal elderly subjects older than age 79. Morphometric measurements on the cerebral MRI were compared between patients with SCA8 and SCA6. The number of the combined CTA/CTG repeats of six affected SCA8 alleles was 106.3+/-24.4 (mean +/- SD) ranging from 89 to 155 and that of normal elderly subjects was 24.3+/-4.4 (n = 104 alleles) ranging from 15 to 34. The mean age at onset of the SCA8 cases was 53.8+/-19.7 years, with a range from 20 to 73 years. One father and daughter from an SCA8 family showed remarkable paternal anticipation. The number increase from father to daughter was + 16 CTG repeats, with a 31-year acceleration of onset. The six identified SCA8 patients were clinically characterized by high frequencies of incoordination of trunk and limbs, ataxic dysarthria, impaired smooth pursuit, and horizontal nystagmus, and the MRI showed significant atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres compared with that of normal controls. There was no significant difference between SCA8 and SCA6 on the morphometric MRI study. The CTG repeat expansions in the SCA8 alleles were much greater than the range of repeats in normal elderly subjects. The SCA8 phenotype manifested by cerebellar symptoms and atrophy corresponded to features of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA III).},

A discriminate analysis showed that 71.4 p. 100 of the cases were correctly classified. This model was validated within a new group of 21 patients and showed that the less severe dysarthric parkinsonian patients were difficult to distinguish from control subjects. The discriminate analysis was then used for 20 patients with atypical parkinsonism. Seven patients with progressive supranuclear palsy were considered to have hypokinetic dysarthria. The 6 patients with multisystem atrophy and 7 with corticobasal degeneration were classified among the 3 dysarthric types. We suggest that motor speech evaluation may contribute to differential diagnosis within groups of patients suffering from atypical parkinsonism.},

Examination of the cineradiographic and spectrographic records revealed conspicuous abnormalities in speaking rate, stress patterns, articulatory placements for both vowels and consonants, velocities of articulator movements, and fundamental frequency contours. In general, our physiological and acoustic observations of ataxic dysarthria were compatible with existing perceptual descriptions of this condition.

Individuals with SBH had more motor speech deficits than controls. Dysfluency was related to an interaction between chronological age and SBH. Speech rate was related independently to chronological age and SBH. Ataxic dysarthria was related to the biology of SBH, and was associated with both physical phenotype (level of spinal cord lesion) and medical history (number of shunt revisions). The data show that developmental as well as acquired lesions of the cerebellum disrupt motor speech, and add to the developmental role of the cerebellum in the automatization of motor skills, including speech.},

It arises from the interaction of distributed neural networks that may be anatomically and functionally lateralized. Intrinsic prosody is mediated largely through left hemisphere mechanisms and encompasses those elements of linguistic microstructure (e.g., syllabic magnitudes and durations, basic consonantal and vocalic gesture specifications, and so) that yield the segmental aspects of speech. Extrinsic prosody is processed primarily by right hemisphere (RH) mechanisms and involves manipulation of intonation across longer perceptual groupings. Intrinsic prosody deficits can lead to several core symptoms of speech apraxia such as difficulty with utterance initiation and syllable transitionalization and may lead to the establishment of inappropriate syllable boundaries. The intrinsic prosody profiles associated with acquired apraxia of speech, developmental speech apraxia, and ataxic dysarthria may aid in the clinical differentiation of these disorders.},

A clinical protocol for the objective assessment of DDK requires a unified approach, however, to facilitate implementation across clinics and laboratories. A protocol for the acoustic analysis of DDK that incorporates temporal and energy measures has been used to describe DDK characteristics for dysarthria secondary to stroke as well as ataxic dysarthria. The current study sought to validate and extend the protocol to a new set of etiological groups, including dysarthria secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The results suggest that temporal measures are more useful than energy measures for distinguishing among dysarthria secondary to MS, dysarthria secondary to PD, and healthy controls. The results also highlight the value of including both alternating and sequential motion rate tasks in the assessment of DDK and of supplementing quantitative measures with qualitative spectrographic observations.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations indicated that pauses in ataxic dysarthric speech are abnormal, but little is known about the nature of their variation or whether it can be characterized by a common distribution. The following types of pauses were measured in spontaneous monologues of 16 speakers with ataxic dysarthria: pauses that contained evidence of respiration, pauses that occurred between words, between phonemes, within phonemes, and those associated with stop consonants. Results showed that the duration of pauses not associated with stop consonants can be modeled with two distinct lognormal distributions. The lognormal distribution predicted duration of across types within 1.67\% standard error, with the exception of pauses that occurred within phonemes. Distributional parameters pointed to some fundamental similarities between pauses that occur within words. The robustness of the lognormal distribution across pause types strongly supports this distribution as a viable and useful method of analysis. We hope this work will encourage others to consider the lognormal distribution.},

An ataxia panel showed 62 repeats in one allele of the SCA2 gene. Most cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) present between 20 years and 40 years, and affected individuals typically have between 34 and 57 CAG repeats. Neonatal cases of SCA2 have been reported in individuals with over 200 CAG repeats. Childhood SCA2 has been reported previously in two patients but not described clinically. This case broadens the spectrum of the clinical features of infantile-onset SCA2 and highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in infants and children.},

Two years earlier, he had been diagnosed as having cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcoholism and hepatitis B virus infection. The patient had progressive ataxic dysarthria and limb and gait ataxia as manifestations of AHCD. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed distinctive symmetrical T2 high-signal intensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brachium pontis, which were consistent with his neurologic deficits. Simultaneously, high T1 signals in the bilateral pallidum and ventral midbrain were noted, which are typical manifestations of AHCD. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 3 months later showed the same cerebellar signs and abnormal signals. The cerebellar cortex and middle cerebellar peduncle are considered highly vulnerable structures to metabolic insults in liver disease.

Characteristics of CMS include complete absence of speech without impaired consciousness, other cranial nerve deficits, or long tract signs.The authors report on 2 patients each of whom developed cerebellar mutism after tumor resection using a posterior fossa approach. The first patient underwent gross total resection of a pineal region tumor via a supracerebellar approach. The second patient underwent posterior fossa decompression for a left cerebellar hemispheric renal cell carcinoma metastasis with adjacent hemorrhage. One patient displayed a variant of cerebellar mutism with severe ataxic dysarthria without complete absence of speech, whereas the other demonstrated frank mutism. After neuroimaging studies confirmed the absence of a surgically treatable postoperative cause for the patients' symptoms, they were managed in a supportive fashion (eg, speech therapy) and improved within 3.5 months and 1 year, respectively.It is paramount that neurosurgeons be aware of cerebellar mutism with regard to its very rare occurrence in adults, its time of onset, and typical self-limiting course.},

Prospective speech and language assessments were then conducted with 5 patients who had PCD. While ataxic dysarthria was the most common speech diagnosis, a spastic component was recognized frequently enough to suggest that the subacute (days to weeks) emergence and progression of an ataxic or mixed ataxic-spastic dysarthria in the setting of a more diffuse cerebellar ataxia should raise suspicions about PCD and justify further investigation of a possible immune-related etiology.},

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) has been identified as being partly caused by a CTG expansion in an untranslated, endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1) gene. Clinically, SCA8 patients show similar features to those with the other SCAs, including limb and truncal ataxia, ataxic dysarthria and horizontal nystagmus, all of which are signs of dysfunction of the cerebellar system. However, allele sizes within the SCA8 proposed pathogenic range have been reported in patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in individuals from pedigrees with other SCA or Friedreich's ataxia, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or parkinsonism. These observations suggest that mutation of the SCA8 locus might affect neurons other than the cerebellum. Antisense transcripts are known to regulate complementary sense transcripts and are involved in several biologic functions, such as development, adaptive response, and viral infection. In order to test whether SCA8 affects the KLHL1 expression by antisense RNA in brain cells, we examined the expression pattern of KLHL1 and SCA8 in human tissues and in mouse brain regions. SCA8 expression was colocalized with KLHL1 transcript in many brain regions whose functions are correlated to the clinical symptoms of SCA8 patients. These findings lead to the hypothesis of a possible relevance that SCA8 transcript downregulates KLHL1 expression through an antisense mechanism, which then leads to SCA8 neuropathogenesis.},

Different variants of speech rhythm were imposed on sentence utterances obtained from two patients with ataxic dysarthria and two normal control speakers. For the sake of comparability the pitch contours were standardized by means of linearly interpolated stylized versions. The introduced manipulations significantly influenced the ratings of perceived slowness, dysfluency, and rhythmic adequacy. With respect to estimates of overall intelligibility and naturalness, however, ataxic-dysarthric utterances did not benefit from any synthetic changes. By contrast, utterances of normal speakers were rated less intelligible and somewhat more unnatural when resynthesized with an ataxic rhythm.

To our knowledge, we describe for the first time a unique clinical feature of Asidan (SCA36)–relatively pure cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron involvement during the course of disease-that puts SCA36 at the crossroad of SCA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

This study compared the intonation patterns of unimpaired participants (CON) and those with Parkinson's disease (PD), ataxic dysarthria (AT), and foreign accent syndrome (FAS) to evaluate the approach's potential for distinguishing types of MSDs from each other and from unimpaired speech. Spontaneous speech from 8 PD, 8 AT, 4 FAS, and 10 CON speakers were analyzed in relation to inventory and prevalence of pitch patterns, accentuation, and phrasing. Acoustic-phonetic baseline measures (maximum-phonation-duration, speech rate, and F0-variability) were also performed. The analyses yielded differences between MSD and CON groups and between the clinical groups in regard to prevalence, accentuation, and phrasing. AT and FAS speakers used more rising and high pitch accents than PD and CON speakers. The AT group used the highest number of pitch accents per phrase, and all 3 MSD groups produced significantly shorter phrases than the CON group. The study succeeded in differentiating MSDs on the basis of intonational performances by using the AM approach, thus, demonstrating its potential for charting intonational profiles in clinical populations.},

In our recent study of acoustic analysis of selected speech samples obtained from normal and ataxic subjects, it was revealed that the ataxic speech diagnosed as having “scanning” was characterized by slower speaking rate, inconsistent segment duration of both vowels and consonants, and significant shortening of phonemically long Japanese vowels, as compared to the normal speech. The findings are apparently different from those reported in the study of ataxic speech characteristics of the subjects speaking Germanic languages. Thus, the impression of “scanning” in Japanese ataxic subjects derives mainly from the breakdown of isochrony in terms of difficulty in keeping the length of segments (morae) of Japanese invariable during speech production. The acoustic analysis of selected Japanese sentences is considered to be one of the appropriate methods for objective evaluation of ataxic symptoms.},

  abstract = {Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility. There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. The features of the speech disturbance of these six major types of dysarthria are distinctive and can assist with diagnosis. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom of many neurological conditions and is commonly associated with progressive neurological disease. It has a profound effect upon the patient and their families as communication is integrally related with expressing personality and social relationships. Speech and language therapy can be used to encourage the person to use the speech that is already available to them more effectively, can increase the range and consistency of sound production, can teach strategies for improving intelligibility and communicative effectiveness, can guide the individual to use methods that are less tiring and more successful, and can introduce the appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication approaches as and when required.},

Method This is a case-control study of 32 children (66\% male) with galactosemia and neurologic speech disorders and 130 controls (50\% male) ages 4-16 years. Speech was assessed using the Percentage of Consonants Correct (PCC) metric from responses to the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2 and from a 5-min recorded speech sample, hand and tongue strength using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument, and coordination using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. The number of days on milk during the neonatal period was obtained by parent report. Analyses of covariance, distributions, and correlations were used to evaluate relationships among speech, strength, coordination, age, gender, and days on milk. Results Children with galactosemia had weaker hand and tongue strength and most (66\%) had significant coordination disorders, primarily affecting balance and manual dexterity. Among children with galactosemia, children with more speech errors and classified as childhood apraxia of speech (n = 7) and ataxic dysarthria (n = 1), had poorer balance and manual dexterity, but not weaker hand or tongue strength, compared to the children with fewer speech errors. The number of days on milk during the neonatal period was associated with more speech errors in males but not in females. Conclusion Children with galactosemia have a high prevalence of co-occurring speech, coordination, and strength disorders, which may be evidence of a common underlying etiology, likely associated with diffuse cerebellar damage, rather than distinct disorders.},

The conduction aphasic group produced force and position stability that typically was not significantly different from any of the remaining three groups, suggesting that their force and position stability as indexed in the present study fell somewhere between that of the normal group and the apraxic and dysarthric groups. It is suggested that other analyses of force and position control, such as descriptive accounts of the trial-by-trial time histories, might shed additional light on the speech and orofacial sensorimotor control deficits in persons with apraxia, dysarthria, and conduction aphasia.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated the processes responsible for selection of sounds and syllables during production of speech sequences in 10 adults with hypokinetic dysarthria from Parkinson's disease, five adults with ataxic dysarthria, and 14 healthy control speakers. Speech production data from a choice reaction time task were analyzed to evaluate the effects of sequence length and practice on speech sound sequencing. Speakers produced sequences that were between one and five syllables in length over five experimental runs of 60 trials each. In contrast to the healthy speakers, speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria demonstrated exaggerated sequence length effects for both inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) and speech error rates. Conversely, speakers with ataxic dysarthria failed to demonstrate a sequence length effect on ISIs and were also the only group that did not exhibit practice-related changes in ISIs and speech error rates over the five experimental runs. The exaggerated sequence length effects in the hypokinetic speakers with Parkinson's disease are consistent with an impairment of action selection during speech sequence production. The absent length effects observed in the speakers with ataxic dysarthria is consistent with previous findings that indicate a limited capacity to buffer speech sequences in advance of their execution. In addition, the lack of practice effects in these speakers suggests that learning-related improvements in the production rate and accuracy of speech sequences involves processing by structures of the cerebellum. Together, the current findings inform models of serial control for speech in healthy speakers and support the notion that sequencing deficits contribute to speech symptoms in speakers with hypokinetic or ataxic dysarthria. In addition, these findings indicate that speech sequencing is differentially impaired in hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria.},

Sequences were comprised of strings of consonant-vowel (CV) syllables with each syllable containing the same vowel, /a/, paired with a different consonant. High complexity sequences contained phonemically similar consonants, and sounds and syllables that had low phonotactic probabilities; low complexity sequences contained phonemically dissimilar consonants and high probability sounds and syllables. Sequence complexity effects were evaluated by analyzing speech error rates and within-syllable vowel and pause durations. This analysis revealed that speech error rates were significantly higher and speech duration measures were significantly longer during production of high complexity sequences than during production of low complexity sequences. Although speakers with dysarthria produced longer overall speech durations than healthy speakers, the effects of sequence complexity on error rates and speech durations were comparable across all groups. These findings indicate that the duration and accuracy of processes for selecting items in a speech sequence is influenced by their phonemic similarity and/or phonotactic probability. Moreover, this robust complexity effect is present even in speakers with damage to subcortical circuits involved in serial control for speech.},

Most desirable would be a causative treatment of the underlying cerebellar disease. This is currently available only for a very small subset of cerebellar ataxias with known metabolic dysfunction. However, increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of hereditary ataxia should lead to an increasing number of medically sensible drug trials. In this paper, data from recent drug trials in patients with recessive and dominant cerebellar ataxias will be summarized. There is consensus that up to date, no medication has been proven effective. Aminopyridines and acetazolamide are the only exception, which are beneficial in patients with episodic ataxia type 2. Aminopyridines are also effective in a subset of patients presenting with downbeat nystagmus. As such, all authors agreed that the mainstays of treatment of degenerative cerebellar ataxia are currently physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. For many years, well-controlled rehabilitation studies in patients with cerebellar ataxia were lacking. Data of recently published studies show that coordinative training improves motor function in both adult and juvenile patients with cerebellar degeneration. Given the well-known contribution of the cerebellum to motor learning, possible mechanisms underlying improvement will be outlined. There is consensus that evidence-based guidelines for the physiotherapy of degenerative cerebellar ataxia need to be developed. Future developments in physiotherapeutical interventions will be discussed including application of non-invasive brain stimulation.},

  abstract = {Although pontine strokes account for a small percentage of all ischaemic events, they can be associated with significant initial disability. These lesions may be missed on computed tomography and therefore magnetic resonance imaging is generally preferred for the assessment of brainstem strokes. The aetiopathogenesis of isolated pontine infarcts, not due to a significant compromise (occlusion or dissection) in the vertebrobasilar territory, still remains to be fully characterised. These strokes present with different symptoms, depending on the lesion location and size, partly reflecting the anatomical variability of the vertebrobasilar vessels. Progressive neurological deterioration is relatively common and has been associated with the extension of such lesions. However, many patients with significant infarcts in the pons will do well in the future and initial diffusion-weighted imaging may not add useful prognostication to the clinical assessment. We discuss here a case where an initially progressive presentation was associated with a marked improvement in both clinical and radiological assessments at 42 days. A 49-year-old white British man presented with left-sided weakness, incoordination, unsteadiness, cerebellar ataxic dysarthria and dysphonia. A baseline magnetic resonance imaging scan with diffusion-weighted imaging, T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences showed an acute bilateral pontine infarct. On a repeat scan at 42 days, there was a 57.5\% decrease in the size of the lesion on the high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted image and a corresponding improvement in the symptoms and the clinical assessments of this patient. The reduction in infarct size was also comparable to the decrease calculated between the baseline diffusion-weighted and the follow-up fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. This case report discusses the significant clinical improvement and corresponding lesion reduction in a patient that presented with worsening neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with acute bilateral ischaemic pontine infarction. Further studies, utilising structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging with follow-up scans, are needed to provide better insights into the underlying aetiopathology and recovery mechanisms of pontine stroke. These will help define the relationship between imaging parameters and outcome allowing for better prognosis along with the development of relevant rehabilitation programs for this group of patients.},

Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.},

She had a 5-year history of left facial palsy, disturbed horizontal eye movements, retrobulbar optic neuritis, spastic paraparesis and bladder and rectal disturbances, some of which had relapsed a few times. Neurological abnormalities were summarized as follows: bilateral pale discs, right Horner's sign, horizontal nystagmus, left facial nerve palsy of peripheral type, spastic paraparesis with left-sided predominance, sensory disturbances below the third cervical segment, truncal and limb ataxia, and bladder and rectal disturbances. Gaze-linked synchronized contraction of the left facial muscles was observed and on the left lateral gaze marked spasm of the left orbicularis oculi muscle with occasional lid closure was evoked. Case 2 was a 72-year-old female with cerebellar hemorrhage. Neurological abnormal findings included mild disorientation, meningeal irritation signs, horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze, reduced response of reflex eye movement to the left, minimal weakness of the left facial muscles, ataxic dysarthria, mild left hemiparesis and hemisensory deficits with face, truncal and limb ataxia.

Oscillographic as well as photographic records of the speech acoustic signal were obtained to analyse interval for a syllable, which consisted of voiced and unvoiced intervals, and peak-value of voiced interval. The results were as follows: 1) ATAXICs and SPASTICs showed prolonged interval for a syllable, yet that of PARKINs was within normal range, when tested either in /a/ or in /pa/. 2) Standard deviation and coefficient of variation for intervals of syllable and those of peak-values in voiced interval could not distinguish their characteristics among ATAXICs, SPASTICs, and PARKINs. 3) In “on-off phonation test”, ATAXICs showed prolonged unvoiced intervals, while SPASTICs did prolonged voiced intervals. Results suggested that hypotonic laryngeal muscles in ATAXICs might result in prolongation of unvoiced interval, but that prolonged voiced interval related to biased hypertonus of laryngeal adductor. It is concluded that “on-off phonation test” could, with reasonable sensitivity, reflect the phonatory dynamics of laryngeal muscles in dysarthric patients.},

An analysis of clinical data is presented and inferences drawn. The propositus from pedigree-I (9-year-old female) could not walk stably and had a history of frequent falls. The symptoms aggravated over time until she lost the ability to take care of herself. Her physical and mental development (including cognitive ability) was normal. She had an ataxic gait, ataxic dysarthria, bilateral horizontal nystagmus and visible limb myoclonus. She failed the bilateral finger-to-nose and heel-knee-tibia tests and could not walk in a straight line. Babinski signs were not observed. EEG tracing during sleep showed low-amplitude spikes and spike-and-slow waves in the bilateral frontal and mid-frontal areas. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan was normal. In pedigree-II, the propositus (a 54-year-old male) could not walk stably and had a history of occasional falls for the past 34 years.

His physical and mental faculties, as well as the neurological findings were similar to those of the pedigree-I. Both proposituses did not respond well to symptomatic treatment. A novel mutation has been identified in SGCE gene (NM₀03919:exon3:c.360delT:p.A120fs) using exome sequencing. PMA patients from the two pedigrees had autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with variability in the age of onset and disease severity.

We postulated that hearing impairment in this patient resulted from transient ischemia of the bilateral auditory tract in the brain stem or the peripheral cochlear system, but the definitive cause of the transient hearing loss remains undetermined. Concomitant appearance of a symmetrical infarction at the cerebellar peduncles is rare. We suggest that a circulation defect involving a multivascular system, which resulted in “border zone infarction” occurred at these regions.},

Since her vomiting continued, she received intravenous dextrose and electrolytes without thiamine in a hospital. One month later, she developed gait disturbance, followed by confusion and dysarthria. On admission to our department, she was confusional and had ataxic dysarthria. Spontaneous and gaze evoked nystagmus was present. Limb coordination was bilaterally ataxic. Based on her clinical course and symptoms, she was diagnosed as having Wernicke's encephalopathy. From the admission day, intravenous infusion of vitamin B1 (600 mg/day) was started. A few days later, her consciousness and limb ataxia began to improve. However, truncal ataxia and polyneuropathy became evident. Eight weeks after onset, she developed Korsakoff's psychosis such as anterograde and retrograde amnesia, disorientation and confabulation. We administered large amounts of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day) in order to reduce brain edema or stabilize the impaired blood-brain barrier. Soon after, her psychosis began to improve gradually. She recovered remarkably from the psychosis, but she was left with persistent nystagmus, mild ataxic gait and polyneuropathy. The present case suggests that corticosteroid may have the beneficial effect on Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.},

Currently there is little agreement in the clinical literature as to the locus or nature of processes involved in production and reception of prosody. This paper investigates the usefulness of two psycholinguistic models of prosody–involving “abstract” and “concrete” processes (Ladd \& Cutler, 1983)–in accounting for dysprosody following motor pathway as well as cortical lesions. Four groups of 10 adult patients each participated in the study; the first group had sustained a right cerebral hemisphere cortical stroke, the second group had hypokinetic dysarthria, the third group had ataxic dysarthria, and the fourth group was normal controls. Acoustic analysis using the Kay VisiPitch/PC was conducted on pairs of matched noun phrase and noun compounds (e.g., greenhouse, green house), interrogative and declarative versions of sentences, and sentences spoken in each of four different emotional tones. Right cerebral hemisphere damaged subjects produced shorter durations than the other groups for each stimulus class. However, all of the subjects were able to use duration to signal temporal information for the lexical distinction between noun compounds and noun phrases. The results are consistent with a model of prosodic control which involves both cortical as well as physiological control processes. Current treatment for dysprosody is discussed in light of this new emphasis on cognitive control processes.},

Subjects with cerebellar tremor and either head trauma or stroke were identified using a computerized database, providing detailed demographic and clinical information of 4002 patients with involuntary movements other than Parkinson's disease seen at our center between 1983 and 1995.

Five patients with stroke or head trauma developed a cerebellar syndrome 3 weeks to 2 years after the initial insult. The syndrome, characterized by intention tremor, ataxic dysarthria, nystagmus, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, and gait ataxia, was progressive in at least one patient. In four patients, lesions were present on neuroimaging in the thalamus or brain stem (especially in the midbrain). A delayed-onset cerebellar syndrome may follow head trauma or stroke. The syndrome is sometimes progressive and often disabling. The delayed onset implies that the syndrome is not caused by the initial lesion itself but may be caused by development of post-synaptic supersensitivity or secondary reorganization of involved pathways.},

Semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar function (SQACF) was also performed. The results of the acoustic analysis of the cerebellar speech were then correlated with the findings in the SQACF. The overlapping of voice onset time highly correlates with truncal ataxia as well as eye movement abnormality and eye-hand coordination. The prolongation of vowel duration also correlates significantly with tandem walking, dysdiadochokinesia and eye movement abnormality. The correlation of the speech function with other cerebellar motor functions provides further insight into the functional anatomy for cerebellar speech motor control. This study concludes that the midline structures-vermis and fastigial nucleus-seem to be the primary focus for the coordination of motor speech in the cerebellum.},

He noticed a moderate dysarthria after a high grade fever in February of 1995; however, two weeks later his symptom disappeared completely. Three months later, he noticed the dysarthria again and he was referred to our hospital for further examination. General physical findings on admission revealed a dark skin color, pigmentation of gingivae and reduced body hair. Neurologically he was normal except for a moderate ataxic dysarthria. Cranial T2-weighted MRI showed multiple high intensity lesions in the subcortical white matter of frontal lobe, bilateral peritrigonal white matter, splenium of the corpus callosum and bilateral cerebellar white matter. Only cerebellar lesions responsible for his symptom were enhanced on MRI after gadolinium administration. Initially we diagnosed him with multiple sclerosis (MS) based upon the clinical course and MRI findings, and then started corticosteroid treatment. His dysarthria was slightly improved after the treatment and bilateral gadolinium-enhanced lesions of cerebellar white matter on MRI disappeared. Multimodality evoked potentials such as short latency somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials, disclosed a prolonged central conduction time associated with bilaterally symmetric individual interpeak latencies. These findings, which supported diffuse and bilateral subclinical demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system, were unusual for MS; therefore his plasma very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) were assayed for ALD. Finally, he was diagnosed with adult type ALD because of the high ratio of C26: 0/C22: 0 (0.075; normal 0.033). It is very difficult to clinically distinguish the early stage of adult type ALD especially in patients like this from MS. Therefore it is useful and important to evaluate not only the level of plasma VLCFA, but also to evaluate multimodality evoked potentials.},

  abstract = {In recent years, phonetic sciences has hosted several debates about the best way to statistically analyze data. The main discussion has been about moving away from analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to linear mixed effects models. Mixed models have the advantage both of allowing for including all data points produced by a participant (instead of computing means for each participant) and accounting for both by-participant and by-item variance. However, plotting of data has not always followed this trend. Often researchers plot participant means and standard error (as based on the number of participants), which, while potentially representative of the data used for an ANOVA, do not match the data used for a mixed effects model. The present paper discusses the shortcomings of traditional data visualization practices, solutions to these shortcomings that have been discussed in recent years, and the special challenges that come with trying to extend these solutions to phonetic data with crossed (withinparticipant and within-item) designs. For each of the problems discussed, we provide examples with simulated data to demonstrate how different plotting techniques can correctly, or incorrectly, represent the underlying structure of data. Ultimately we conclude that there is no single type of plot that can show everything one needs to know about this type of data, and we advocate for an approach that involves using different types of plots throughout data analysis, and making data publicly available.},

The angle of approach, however, influences the resultant field of stimulation and can lead to undesired side effects. We review a case where symptomatic improvement was accompanied by significant side effects despite reasonable STN stereotactic base coordinates. Revision of the lead using similar base coordinates but a significantly different angle of approach greatly improved the outcome. Stimulation ventromedial to the STN improved tremors but brought about dysarthria and dystonia. Computer-based stimulation field modeling helped understand the regions associated with the side effects and illustrate the difference between pre- and post-revision stimulation fields. Lead angle can impact DBS outcome and should be taken into consideration.}

  abstract = {We describe a personal series of 60 cases of parkinsonism with onset under the age of 40 years. Known causes for early onset of secondary parkinsonism, such as Wilson's disease or encephalitis, were excluded in every case. Two groups were identified: those with onset after the age of 21 in whom no hereditary factors could be ascertained (56 cases), and those with onset before 21 years all of whom had familial parkinsonism. In neither group have we found any association with prematurely grey hair, hypertension, diabetes, pernicious anaemia, or thyroid disorder. Among their families, we have not found any association with diabetes, pernicious anaemia, or thyroid disorder. We propose that cases of apparent idiopathic Parkinson's disease begining between age 21–40 years should be called “young onset Parkinson's disease.” Twenty percent of such patients in our series had at least one first- or second-degree relative in the same or antecedent generations with parkinsonism, but only 1.5\% of their relatives at risk had parkinsonism, which is similar to the prevalence in the general population. Ten percent of these patients had at least one relative with essential tremor, but only 1.6\% of their relatives at risk had tremor, which again was similar to the prevalence in the population in general. These patients with young onset Parkinson's disease responded well to levodopa therapy. However, dyskinesias and response fluctuations occurred early and frequently. The prevalence of dyskinesias and response fluctuations was strongly correlated with the duration of levodopa treatment, but not with the duration (or probably the severity) of the disease before levodopa therapy was commenced. The involuntary movements often were severe and frequently were diphasic. Despite long disease duration, the incidence of dementia in young onset patients aged less than 65 years was negligible. We believe that most, if not all, patients in this group have degenerative Lewy body idiopathic Parkinson's disease, representing the lower end of a skewed deviation for age of onset of this disease. We have so far failed to identify any additional environmental factor which may have accelerated disease onset in these patients. In contrast, cases of parkinsonism beginning before age 21 years were invariably familial. We proposed that they should be called “juvenile parkinsonism.” All affected relatives with parkinsonism also had young disease onset, and all but one were siblings. None of four such patients seen by us has demented, and computed tomography (CT) scan has been normal in all four. We believe that most such patients have some form of genetically determined secondary parkinsonism.},

The present paper discuss the role and status of various countries related to wearing of masks by the public, as a crucial measure to minimize the spared of virus. Almost all the countries across the globe have favor the use of masks in public with several other measures.

Speech intelligibility was assessed using the modified rhyme  test in an intensive care unit environment. Respirators decreased speech  intelligibility by a range of 1\% to 17\%, although not all were statistically  significant. Differences in speech intelligibility associated with surgical masks  and disposable filtering facepiece respirators (without exhalation valves) were not  statistically significant compared with controls. Wearing half-face elastomeric  respirators with voice augmentation equipment was associated with higher speech  intelligibility than models without this equipment (OR = 2.81). Hearing clarity  while wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) was 79\% compared with 90\%  with no PAPR (OR = 0.40). While some respirators appear to have little or no effect  on speech intelligibility, interference with speech intelligibility associated with  certain types of respirators commonly worn by U.S. healthcare workers may be  substantial.},

In the present study, we compared acoustic voice measures in recordings of sixteen adults producing standardised vocal tasks with and without wearing either a surgical mask or a KN95 mask. Data were analysed for mean spectral levels at 0-1 kHz and 1-8 kHz regions, an energy ratio between 0-1 and 1-8 kHz (LH1000), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS), and vocal intensity. In connected speech there was significant attenuation of mean spectral level at 1-8 kHz region and there was no significant change in this measure at 0-1 kHz. Mean spectral levels of vowel did not change significantly in mask-wearing conditions. LH1000 for connected speech significantly increased whilst wearing either a surgical mask or KN95 mask but no significant change in this measure was found for vowel. HNR was higher in the mask-wearing conditions than the no-mask condition. CPPS and vocal intensity did not change in mask-wearing conditions. These findings implied an attenuation effects of wearing these types of masks on the voice spectra with surgical mask showing less impact than the KN95.},

  abstract = {Method. Thirty-one participants with PD were randomly allocated to three study groups (control group n = 10, inspiratory training group, n = 11, and expiratory training group, n = 11). The inspiratory and expiratory group performed a home-based inspiratory and expiratory muscle training program, respectively (five sets of five repetitions). Both groups trained six times a week for 2 months using a progressively increased resistance. The control group performed expiratory muscle training using the same protocol and a fixed resistance. Phonatory measures, maximum inspiratory/expiratory pressure, and spirometric indexes were assessed before and at 2 months after training. Results. Differences in peak subglottic pressure were moderate (d = 0.59) between expiratory and inspiratory groups, large between inspiratory and control groups (d = 1.32), and large between expiratory and control groups (d = 1.96). Differences in maximum phonation time were large (d = 1.26) between inspiratory and control groups, moderate (negative) between expiratory and inspiratory groups (d = −0.60), and moderate between expiratory and control groups (d = 0.72). Differences in peak sound pressure level were large (d = 1.27) between inspiratory and control groups, trivial between expiratory and inspiratory groups (d = −0.18), and large between expiratory and control groups (d = 1.10). Conclusions. Inspiratory muscle training is effective in improving maximum phonation time, and expiratory muscle training is more effective for improving peak subglottic pressure, and peak sound pressure level in individuals with PD.},

  abstract = {Exhalation valves (EVs) are touted as useful in dissipating humidity, heat, and carbon dioxide from the dead space of N95 filtering facepiece respirators and decreasing exhalation resistance, thereby making the respirator more comfortable and less physiologically demanding. Despite decades of use, there is limited research on the psychophysiological impact of EVs on the wearer at the current, low-moderate work rates of many workers. The available literature indicates that past and current EVs on the market decrease exhalation resistance to a variable degree and may improve dead space heat dissipation and, consequently, the temperature of the skin covered by the respirator. EVs have little substantial effect on dead space humidity, respiratory rate, heart rate, core temperature, speech intelligibility, or dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at the aforementioned work rates. The studies also indicate that EVs may impact comfort and tolerance when N95 filtering facepiece respirators are worn for extended periods or at high work rates. Because comfort and tolerance impact respirator use compliance and, by extension, protection, more research into the psychophysiological impact of EVs on wearers and the development of new EVs tailored for low-moderate work rates are warranted.},

This work contributes further evidence for the multi-dimensionality of prosodic prominence in German reporting articulatory (3D EMA) and acoustic recordings from 27 speakers. In particular, we show that speakers use specific categorical and continuous modifications of the laryngeal system (tonal onglide) as well as continuous modifications of the supra-laryngeal system (lip aperture and tongue body position) to mark focus structure prosodically. These modifications are found between unaccented and accented but also within the group of accented words, revealing that speakers use prosodic modulations to directly encode prominence. On the basis of these findings we develop a dynamical model of prosodic patterns that is able to capture the manipulations as the modulation of an attractor landscape that is shaped by the different prosodic dimensions involved.},

  abstract = {Method. Eighteen healthy participants with normal voice were included in this study. After task training, participants produced repeated syllable combinations at comfortable, maximal and minimal levels of vocal effort. A pneumotachometer and vented (Rothenberg) mask were used to record aerodynamic data, with simultaneous recording of the acoustic signal for subsequent analysis. Aerodynamic measures of subglottal pressure, translaryngeal airflow, maximum flow declination rate (MFDR), and laryngeal resistance were analyzed, along with acoustic measures of cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and its standard deviation (SD). Results. Participants produced significantly greater subglottal pressure, translaryngeal airflow, and MFDR during maximal effort speech as compared with comfortable vocal effort. When producing speech at minimal vocal effort, participants lowered subglottal pressure, MFDR, and laryngeal resistance. Acoustic changes associated with changes in vocal effort included significantly higher CPP during maximal effort speech and significantly lower CPP SD during minimal effort speech, when each was compared with comfortable effort. Conclusions. For healthy speakers without voice disorders, subglottal pressure, translaryngeal airflow, and MFDR may be important factors that contribute to an increased sense of vocal effort. Changes in the cepstral signal also occur under conditions of increased or decreased vocal effort relative to comfortable effort.},

  abstract = {Wearing a face mask affects the speech production. On top of that, the frequency response and radiation characteristics of the face mask - depending on the material and shape of the mask - adds to the complexity of analyzing speech under face mask. Our target is to separate the effect of muscle constriction and increased vocal effort in speech produced under face mask from sound transmission and radiation properties of face mask. In this paper, we measure up the far-field effects of wearing four different face masks; motorcycle helmet, rubber mask, surgical mask and scarf inside anechoic chamber. The measurement setup follows the recording configuration of a speech corpus used for speaker recognition experiments. In matching speech under face mask with speech under no mask, the frequency response of the respective face mask is accounted for and compensated for before acoustic feature extraction. The speaker recognition performance is reported using the state-of-the-art i-vector method for mismatched and compensated conditions in order to demonstrate the significance of knowing the type of mask and accounting for its sound transmission properties.},

  abstract = {Speech under face cover constitute a case that is increasingly met by forensic speech experts. Wearing face cover mostly happens when an individual strives to conceal his or her identity. Based on the material of face cover and the level of contact with speech production organs, speech production becomes affected by face mask and a part of speech energy gets absorbed in the mask. There has been little research on how speech acoustics is affected by different face masks and how face covers might affect performance of automatic speaker recognition systems. In the present paper, we have collected speech under face mask with the aim of studying the effects of wearing different masks on state-of-the-art text-independent automatic speaker recognition system. The preliminary speaker recognition rates along with mask identification experiments are presented in this paper.},

Method               A scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews, checklist, and explanation. English-language, full-text resources were identified through Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global.                                         Results               A total of 1,072 sources were retrieved; of these, 109 were duplicates. Titles of abstracts of 963 articles were screened, with 295 selected for full-text review. Using the exclusion and inclusion criteria listed, 236 articles were considered eligible and 214 different triggers were identified. Triggers were identified from North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Occupational exposures were also delineated.                                         Conclusions               A clinically useful checklist of both frequently encountered triggers and idiosyncratic or rare triggers was developed. The clinical checklist provides a unique contribution to streamline and standardize clinical assessment of irritant-induced chronic cough. The international scope of this review extends the usefulness of the clinical checklist to clinicians on most continents.},

All subjects showed a number of signs of decreased speech rate, increased pause duration, increased and more variable durations of alternating motion rate, sequential motion rate syllables and inter-stress intervals in addition to vocal instability. These signs were consistent with the perceptual judgment of ataxic dysarthria. Furthermore, the severity of impairment found using these speech analysis methods seemed to correspond to the general severity of the disease and the duration of the illness in these few subjects.

In the present study speech samples from 21 subjects with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and 21 matched control subjects were analyzed using perceptual and acoustic methodology. Dysarthria assessment showed that subjects had mild or mild-moderate dysarthria. Perceptual analysis indicated that equalized stress, imprecise consonants, vocal instability, monotony and reduced speech rate were the speech parameters that yielded the highest mean perceptual ratings. A factor analysis of perceptual speech parameters revealed two main factors: Factor 1 was associated with articulatory timing and Factor 2 with vocal quality. Acoustic analysis revealed significantly reduced speech rate during text reading, reduced alternating and sequential motion rates (AMR/SMR), significantly longer and more variable syllable and pause durations, and significantly higher vocal instability for subjects with SCA compared to control subjects.},

  abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias clinically characterized by progressive ataxia, dysarthria and a range of other concomitant neurological symptoms. Only a few studies include detailed characterization of speech symptoms in SCA. Speech symptoms in SCA resemble ataxic dysarthria but symptoms related to phonation may be more prominent. One study to date has shown an association between differences in speech and voice symptoms related to genotype. More studies of speech and voice phenotypes are motivated, to possibly aid in clinical diagnosis. In addition, instrumental speech analysis has been demonstrated to be a reliable measure that may be used to monitor disease progression or therapy outcomes in possible future pharmacological treatments. Intervention by speech and language pathologists should go beyond assessment. Clinical guidelines for management of speech, communication and swallowing need to be developed for individuals with progressive cerebellar ataxia.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the extent to which speakers manipulate featural distinctions when trying to clarify misunderstood speech, focusing on voicing contrasts in stops and height and backness (represented by F1 and F2) and durational contrasts in vowels. Participants interacted with a simulated speech recognizer, repeating words when they were “guessed” incorrectly. Both phonemically voiced and voiceless stops showed more extreme VOT values when elicited by an incorrect guess in which the consonant was a minimal pair in voicing with the target consonant (e.g. subject reads “bit”, computer guesses “pit”), but not when elicited by an open-ended request for repetition (e.g. subject reads “bit”, computer guesses “What did you say?”). A follow-up study showed that the change in VOT between the two repetitions was only present when the incorrect guess contrasted in voicing, but not when it contrasted in place or manner. In contrast, for vowels, the amount and direction of formant change in the F1–F2 space was not significantly different from zero for either type of incorrect guess. However, when there was a durational component to the vowel contrast (/i/ vs. =ɪ=), speakers exaggerated the durational differences between the segments, as opposed to when there was not a durational contrast (e.g. /i/ vs. /u/). The results show that speakers perform local, systematic, and phonologically informed manipulations of temporal contrasts online when clarifying phonetic segments.},

Thus each word differed (near-) minimally from six others. In a “neutral” condition each participant read aloud from a randomised wordlist. A “clear” condition was an interactive task in which an interlocutor had to repeat back every word correctly, despite their hearing being impaired by headphone-delivered noise. If the speaker was mis-perceived by the interlocutor, the speaker tried again, until the word was correctly repeated. We describe the surprisingly speaker-specific acoustic hyperspeech effects (in vowel F1, vowel space area, and acoustic segment durations) in the clear speech. A companion paper describes the associated articulatory changes.},

In this context, the contrastive FOCUS shows not only a L+H* pitch accent, but also a following phonological phrase break, marked by both a L- phrase accent and temporal disjuncture. In the same context, presentational focus shows a pitch accent H* and no phonological phrase break (no L- and no disjuncture). Since these differences in prosody correlating with different Focus types are not plausibly construed as the realization of distinct tonal morphemes, I suggest that the contrastive/presentational contrast is present in the interface informational/syntactic structure itself, and makes itself felt in the phonological representation through the action of syntax-phonology interface constraints which distinguish the two Focus types.},

Three hundred and twenty children in age groups 4–11 years learned a song and were then recorded singing alone. LTAS curves were calculated for each voice. Age of each singer was estimated and gender attributed by a panel of independent listeners. Rate of gender identification (71\%) was consonant with that reported for children’s speech. Progressive statistically significant shifts of spectral energy as a function of increasing age (reported in a previous study) were found to be present in the data for both genders, but the developmental timetable over which the changes took place was earlier for girls than for boys. A theoretical basis for the developmental changes is proposed.},

Method       MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, OTseeker, Scopus, Google Scholar,          Grey Literature Database, and ProQuest Search (Dissertations \& Theses) were searched          for relevant studies. The Covidence software was used to manage the initial and full-text          screening process for the search.              Results and Discussion       From a total of 1,803 studies, 68 studies were included for full-text screening. In          addition, 418 records from gray literature were also screened. After full-text screening,          16 studies were included for this review—12 studies for auditory comprehension in          PWA and four studies for reading comprehension in PWA. The review highlights the use          of common eye tracking paradigms used to study language comprehension in PWA. We also          discusse eye movement measures and how they help in assessing auditory and reading          comprehension. Methodological challenges of using eye tracking are discussed.              Conclusion       The studies summarized in this scoping review provide evidence that the eye tracking          methods are beneficial for studying auditory and reading comprehension in PWA.},

  abstract = {Objective The~Coronavirus Disease 2019~(COVID-19) is an ongoing~global pandemic~and wearing face mask is recommended across the globe to break the transmission chain of infection. The masks available in the market are of different types and materials and tend to alter the voice characteristics of the speaker. This can therefore impair optimal communication and the present study is a systematic review exploring the effect of various masks on voice production parameters. Study Design Systematic review. Materials and Methods The titles and abstracts screening was carried out for the inclusion of articles using eight electronic databases spanning the period from 1st January 2020 to 30th April 2021. 10 articles (8 published \& 2 in pre-print) that met the inclusion criteria were considered for this systematic review and the pooled age range was 18 –69 years. Results Three primary studies from the USA, 2 each from Australia \& Italy, one each from Brazil, China, and Germany were found to have investigated the influence of wearing N95, KN95, surgical and fabric masks on voice related measures. The users significantly reported vocal fatigue, discomfort, and also perceived voice problems. Attenuation of speech sound amplitude was highest for the transparent mask followed by cloth mask, N95, KN95, and surgical mask. Conclusion The World Health Organization (WHO) has been repeatedly endorsing the need to use a face mask in the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, for an unintruded voice production, the surgical mask is recommended for everyone, including healthcare professionals when they are not in close contact with patients, and not involved in aerosol-generating procedures. For teachers, doing direct teaching (offline classes), ‘surgical mask’ can reduce the vocal load of teachers, smoothen the teacher-student interaction and thereby facilitate better learning by the students. Additionally, it would be useful to protect oneself from the risk of developing voice problems by following standard vocal healthcare tips.},

Ten minutes from each presentation given by 50 male speakers, for a total of 500 minutes, has been automatically recognized for the analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to the word recognition accuracy and various speaker attributes. A restricted set of the speaker attributes comprising the speaking rate, the out of vocabulary rate and the repair rate was found to be most significant to yield individual differences in the word accuracy. Unsupervised MLLR speaker adaptation worked well for improving the word accuracy but did not change the structure of the individual differences. Approximately half of the variance in the word accuracy was explained by a regression model using the limited set of three attributes.},

  abstract = {Voice Onset Time (VOT), a key measurement of speech for basic research and applied medical studies, is the time between the onset of a stop burst and the onset of voicing. When the voicing onset precedes burst onset the VOT is negative; if voicing onset follows the burst, it is positive. In this work, we present a deep-learning model for accurate and reliable measurement of VOT in naturalistic speech. The proposed system addresses two critical issues: it can measure positive and negative VOT equally well, and it is trained to be robust to variation across annotations. Our approach is based on the structured prediction framework, where the feature functions are defined to be RNNs. These learn to capture segmental variation in the signal. Results suggest that our method substantially improves over the current state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous work, our Deep and Robust VOT annotator, Dr.VOT, can successfully estimate negative VOTs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on positive VOTs. This high level of performance generalizes to new corpora without further retraining.

In 121 PD patients and 70 healthy controls, an acoustical analysis was performed on the first and last sentence of a standardized 170-syllabic text, using a commercial audio software. Articulatory rate and speech to pause ratios were calculated by measuring the length of each syllable and each pause both at the end of words and within polysyllabic words. No significant difference in overall articulatory rate was found between PD patients and controls. Both groups showed an accelerated speech rate in the last sentence compared to the first; however, PD patients had a higher speech acceleration than did controls. PD patients exhibited a significantly reduced percental pause duration in relation to total speech time in the first sentence and a reduced percental pause time within polysyllabic words. PD patients made significantly less but longer pauses at the end of words and less pauses within polysyllabic words. UPDRS III showed an inverse relation to number and rate of intraword pauses, and disease duration was negatively correlated with articulatory rate. The characteristics of parkinsonian speech feature was not only a stronger acceleration of articulation rate in the course of speaking but also a significant reduction of the total numbers of pauses, indicating an impaired speech rhythm and timing organization.},

Assessment of motor impairment was performed on the basis of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale/Motor Score III and further symp- tom-related subscores. F0 variability was reduced in male and female PD patients, whereas meanF0 was found to be elevated in male patients with PD only. No significant difference in overall articulatory rate was found between PD patients and controls, but patients showed a reduction of percentual pause time within polysyllabic words (Pinw\%). Female PD patients showed an additional reduction of percentual pause ratio (PR\%). Variables of intonation and artic- ulatory rate were not correlated to each other. Strong correlations were seen between some distinct prosodic variables and the axial and akinesia parkinsonian symptoms with some gender-related particularities. Reduction of F0 variability and Pinw\% are the most conspicuous features of parkinsonian dysprosody with some further gender-related characteristics. Changes of intonation variability and speech velocity seem to be controlled by different pathophysiological conditions. In consideration of some gender differences, several distinct aspects of dysprosody can be interpreted as axial and akinesia symptoms of PD.},

We review major findings that identify talker, listener and signal characteristics that contribute to the characteristically high intelligibility of clear speech. Understanding the interplay of these factors sheds light on the interaction between higher level cognitive and lower-level sensory and perceptual factors that affect language processing. Clear speech research is, thus, relevant for both its theoretical insights and practical applications. Throughout the review, we highlight open questions and promising future directions.},

Method               Ten children (11–13 years of age), 10 young adults (18–29 years of age), and 10 older adults (60–84 years of age) read sentences in conversational and clear speaking style in quiet and in noise. A number of acoustic measurements were obtained.                                         Results               NAS and CS were characterized by a decrease in speaking rate and an increase in 1–3 kHz energy, sound pressure level (SPL), vowel space area (VSA), and harmonics-to-noise ratio. NAS increased fundamental frequency (F0) mean and decreased jitter and shimmer. CS increased frequency and duration of pauses. Older adults produced the slowest speaking rate, longest pauses, and smallest increase in F0 mean, 1–3 kHz energy, and SPL when speaking clearly. They produced the smallest increases in VSA in NAS and CS. Children slowed down less, increased the VSA least, increased harmonics-to-noise ratio, and decreased jitter and shimmer most in CS. Children increased mean F0 and F1 most in noise.                                         Conclusions               Findings have implications for a model of speech production in healthy speakers as well as the potential to aid in clinical decision making for individuals with speech disorders, particularly dysarthria.},

It looks at the acoustic-articulatory features of conversational-to-clear-speech modifications and continues by examining evidence of their effect on linguistic and cognitive processing. The chapter examines the evidence linking speech modifications with signal-dependent and relatively signal-independent processing benefits. While increased intelligibility is a well-documented CS benefit, little is known about how conversational to clear speech modifications interact with and facilitate different linguistic processes and cognitive functioning. The chapter examines how different tasks, communicative barriers, and talker-related characteristics affect speaking style modifications aimed at enhancing speech understanding. Combining insights from speech intelligibility research with psycholinguistic approaches, physiological measures, and work on signal processing could prove a fruitful strategy for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying CS enhanced intelligibility.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing has been recognised as a concern regarding respirator use and is related to symptoms of discomfort, fatigue, dizziness, headache, muscular weakness and drowsiness. Previous investigations are limited by small sample size and have not evaluated the relationship between CO2 inhalation and phonic respiration (breathing during speech) in respiratory protective devices (RPDs). A total of 40 workers trained in the use of RPDs performed a graded exercise test on a cycle ergonometer that increased in workload every 5 min. During the third minute of each stage, participants read aloud a prepared text. Measures of mixed expired CO2 (PECO2), mixed inspired CO2 (PICO2) and respiration were monitored. The results showed that phonic respiration and low work rates contributed to significantly higher levels of CO2 rebreathing. Aiming to reduce CO2 exposure may result in improved wear time of RPDs. It is recommended that these findings be incorporated in technical specifications regarding human factors for RPDs. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing in respiratory protective devices (RPDs) has been highlighted as a key concern regarding respirator use. However, the problem is relatively under researched. This paper presents novel findings on the impact of phonic respiration (breathing during speech) and CO2 concentrations in RPDs.},

  abstract = {The speech characteristics of ataxic dysarthria are known to be quite diverse. The varied presentation of this dysarthria challenges researchers and clinicians alike, and brings into question whether it is a single entity. While the possibility of subtypes of ataxic dysarthria has been suggested, the nature of these putative groups remains unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if perceptual speech characteristics would align with a pattern of unusual variability or unusual consistency across speech subsystems and speaking tasks. A framework of speech characteristics was created from the existing literature that clustered speech attributes according to notions of instability (unusual variability) or inflexibility (unusual consistency). These speech features were used to develop a perceptual rating form. Ten experienced speech-language pathologists listened to pre-recorded, exemplary samples of 10 speakers with ataxic dysarthria and rated the perceptual speech features. Results suggested that five speakers fit the pattern of instability, one speaker aligned with inflexibility and four speakers had a mixed presentation. Intra-rater reliability was satisfactory. This study adds to the sparse, yet growing, literature to support the existence of subgroups in ataxic dysarthria. The more frequent occurrence of the instability profile is consistent with primary disruption to the timing function of the cerebellar circuit. Identification of subgroups has important clinical and research implications and further research is warranted.},

  abstract = {The question of if and to what extent listeners’ perceptual phonetic categories are sensitive to prosodically driven variability has been a topic of interest in the literature. The present study reports on two experiments which address this question in light of recent research. In Experiment 1, listeners categorized a VOT continuum as /p/ or /b/ in a target syllable (/pɑ/ or /bɑ/). The target was placed in a carrier phrase where the duration and f0 of the pre-target syllable were manipulated. Results suggest listeners are sensitive to intonational structure in their computation of speech rate, interpreting a short syllable with low-rising f0 (created from an L-H\% boundary tone in English intonational phonology) as an increase in speech rate. This perceived increase in rate shifts the category boundary of the subsequent target VOT. Experiment 2 showed listeners similarly adjusted categorization of a vowel duration continuum, where vowel duration is a cue to a following obstruent’s voicing (categorized as "coat" or "code"). Taken together, these results suggest that listeners are sensitive to intonational structure in their perception of segmental contrasts and use the distribution of tonal targets over a given temporal interval in computing speech rate.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to create an empirical classification system for speech severity in patients with dysarthria secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by exploring the reliability and validity of speechlanguage pathologists' (SLPs') ratings of dysarthric speech. Method: Ten SLPs listened to speech samples from 52 speakers with ALS and 20 healthy control speakers. SLPs were asked to rate the speech severity of the speakers using five response options: normal, mild, moderate, severe, and profound. Four severity-surrogate measures were also calculated: SLPs transcribed the speech samples for the calculation of speech intelligibility and rated the effort it took to understand the speakers on a visual analog scale. In addition, speaking rate and intelligible speaking rate were calculated for each speaker. Intrarater and interrater reliability were calculated for each measure. We explored the validity of clinician-based severity ratings by comparing them to the severity-surrogate measures. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to create optimal cutoff points for defining dysarthria severity categories. Results: Intrarater and interrater reliability for the clinician-based severity ratings were excellent and were comparable to reliability for the severity-surrogate measures explored. Clinician severity ratings were strongly associated with all severity-surrogate measures, suggesting strong construct validity. We also provided a range of values for each severity-surrogate measure within each severity category based on the cutoff points obtained from the ROC analyses. Conclusions: Clinician severity ratings of dysarthric speech are reliable and valid. We discuss the underlying challenges that arise when selecting a stratification measure and offer recommendations for a classification scheme when stratifying patients and research participants into speech severity categories.},

  abstract = {The Four-Level Framework of speech sensorimotor control (Van der Merwe, 1997) complicates the traditional view of dysarthria as a purely motor execution disorder. According to this framework, hypokinetic, hyperkinetic and ataxic dysarthria are programming-execution dysarthrias, while flaccid dysarthria is the only execution dysarthria. This preliminary study aimed to differentiate programming-execution dysarthria from execution dysarthria by examining variability of the temporal control of speech. Six participants and five control participants repeated 15 stimulus words ten times. Voice onset time, vowel duration, vowel steady state duration and vowel formant transition duration were measured acoustically. The coefficient of variation of the temporal parameters, and the correlation coefficient between the durational parameters, were calculated and analysed using descriptive statistics. The coefficient of variation revealed that the speakers with dysarthria were more variable than the control speakers. All participants, except those with flaccid dysarthria, showed similar patterns of intra-subject variability. Those with flaccid dysarthria exhibited greater intra-subject variability of voice onset time. The correlation analysis did not reveal differences between dysarthria type, or between the dysarthric speakers and the controls. Differences found in the patterns of variability may support the hypothesis that individuals with programming-execution dysarthria resort to a different level of control than those with execution dysarthria. Further research in this field is necessary.},

  institution = {{University of Colorado at Boulder}},
  abstract = {Although much is known about the linguistic function of vowel nasality, either contrastive (as in French) or coarticulatory (as in English), less is known about its perception. This study uses careful examination of production patterns, along with data from both machine learning and human listeners to establish which acoustical features are useful (and used) for identifying vowel nasality. A corpus of 4,778 oral and nasal or nasalized vowels in English and French was collected, and feature data for 29 potential perceptual features was extracted. A series of Linear Mixed-Effects Regressions showed 7 promising features with large oral-to-nasal feature differences, and highlighted some cross-linguistic differences in the relative importance of these features. Two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and RandomForests, were trained on this data to identify features or feature groupings that were most effective at predicting nasality token-by-token in each language. The list of promising features was thus narrowed to four: A1-P0, Vowel Duration, Spectral Tilt, and Formant Frequency/Bandwidth. These four features were manipulated in vowels in oral and nasal contexts in English, adding nasal features to oral vowels and reducing nasal features in nasalized vowels, in an attempt to influence oral/nasal classification. These stimuli were presented to native English listeners in a lexical choice task with phoneme masking, measuring oral/nasal classification accuracy and reaction time. Only modifications to vowel formant structure caused any perceptual change for listeners, resulting in increased reaction times, as well as increased oral/nasal confusion in the oral-to-nasal (feature addition) stimuli. Classification of already-nasal vowels was not affected by any modifications, suggesting a perceptual role for other acoustical characteristics alongside nasality-specific cues. A Support Vector Machine trained on the same stimuli showed a similar pattern of sensitivity to the experimental modifications. Thus, based on both the machine learning and human perception results, formant structure, particularly F1 bandwidth, appears to be the primary cue to the perception of nasality in English. This close relationship of nasal- and oral-cavity derived acoustical cues leads to a strong perceptual role for both the oral and nasal aspects of nasal vowels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reliability of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) depends on correct fitting. The perceived usability of FFRs is equally important because discomfort during usage may affect compliance. Body movements during nursing procedures may also increase the risk of face seal leakage. AIM: To evaluate the mask fit and usability of the best-fitting 3M N95 FFR and the nanofibre N95 FFR before and after nursing procedures. The physical properties of these FFRs were also examined. METHODS: This experimental study had a one-group multiple comparison design. In total, 104 nursing students participated, and performed nursing procedures for 10 min when wearing the best-fitting 3M FFR and the nanofibre FFR. Mask fit and perceived usability of the FFRs were evaluated. FINDINGS: More participants failed to obtain a fit factor ≥100 when using the best-fitting 3M FFR than when wearing the nanofibre FFR (33.7\% vs 21.2\%) after the procedures (P=0.417). The nanofibre FFR also demonstrated higher usability than the 3M FFRs in terms of facial heat, breathability, facial pressure, speech intelligibility, itchiness, difficulty of maintaining the mask in place, and comfort level (P{$<$}0.001). The nanofibre FFR was also lighter, thinner and had slightly higher bacterial filtration efficiency than the 3M FFRs. CONCLUSION: The nanofibre FFR demonstrated significantly better usability than the 3M FFRs. None of the respirators were able to provide consistent protection for the wearer, as detected by face seal leakage after performing nursing procedures. Further improvement in the prototype design is needed to increase compliance and ensure the respiratory protection of users.},

  abstract = {Purpose       This tutorial addresses fundamental characteristics of microphones (frequency response,          frequency range, dynamic range, and directionality), which are important for accurate          measurements of voice and speech.              Method       Technical and voice literature was reviewed and analyzed. The following recommendations          on desirable microphone characteristics were formulated: The frequency response of          microphones should be flat (i.e., variation of less than 2 dB) within the frequency          range between the lowest expected fundamental frequency of voice and the highest spectral          component of interest. The equivalent noise level of the microphones is recommended          to be at least 15 dB lower than the sound level of the softest phonations. The upper          limit of the dynamic range of the microphone should be above the sound level of the          loudest phonations. Directional microphones should be placed at the distance that          corresponds to their maximally flat frequency response, to avoid the proximity effect;          otherwise, they will be unsuitable for spectral and level measurements. Numerical          values for these recommendations were derived for the microphone distances of 30 cm          and 5 cm.              Conclusions       The recommendations, while preliminary and in need of further numerical justification,          should provide the basis for better accuracy and repeatability of studies on voice          and speech production in the future.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice and speech disorders are one of the most important issues after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Objective: We studied the articulation features of PD patients with STN-DBS. Methods: Participants were 56 PD patients treated with STN-DBS (STN-DBS group) and 41 patients treated only with medical therapy (medical-therapy-alone group). Articulation function was evaluated with acoustic and auditory-perceptual analyses. The vowel space area (VSA) was calculated using the formant frequency data of three vowels (/a/, /i/, and /u/) from sustained phonation task. The VSA reportedly reflects the distance of mouth/jaw and tongue movements during speech and phonation. Correlations between acoustic and auditory-perceptual measurements were also assessed. Results: The VSA did not significantly differ between the medical-therapy-alone group and the STN-DBS group in the off-stimulation condition. In the STN-DBS group, the VSA was larger in the on-stimulation condition than in the off-stimulation condition. However, individual analysis showed the VSA changes after stopping stimulation were heterogeneous. In total, 89.8\% of the STN-DBS group showed a large VSA size in the on- than in the off-stimulation condition. In contrast, the VSA of the remaining patients in that group was smaller in the on- than the off-stimulation condition. Conclusions: STN-DBS may resolve hypokinesia of the articulation structures, including the mouth/jaw and tongue, and improve maximal vowel articulation. However, in the on-stimulation condition, the VSA was not significantly correlated with speech intelligibility. This may be because STN-DBS potentially affects other speech processes such as voice and/or respiratory process.},

  abstract = {Voice clinicians require an objective, reliable, and relatively auto-matic method to assess voice change after medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. This measure must be sensitive to a variety of voice qualities and severities, and preferably should reflect voice in continuous speech. The long-term average spectrum (LTAS) is a fast Fourier transform-generated power spectrum whose properties can be compared with a Gaussian bell curve using spectral moments analysis. Four spectral moments describe features of the LTAS: Spectral mean (Moment 1) and standard deviation (Moment 2) represent the spectrum's central tendency and dispersion, respectively. Skew-ness (based on Moment 3) and kurtosis (based on Moment 4) represent the spectrum's tilt and peakedness, respectively. To examine whether the first four spectral moments of the LTAS were sensitive to perceived voice improvement after voice therapy, this investigation compared pretreatment and post-treatment voice samples of 93 patients with functional dysphonia using spectral moments analysis. Inspection of the results revealed that spectral mean and standard deviation lowered significantly with perceived voice improvement after successful behavioral management (p Ͻ 0.001). However, changes in skewness and kurtosis were not significant. Furthermore, lowering of the spectral mean uniquely accounted for approximately 14\% of the variance in the pretreatment to posttreatment changes observed in perceptual ratings of voice severity (p Ͻ 0.001), indicating that spectral mean (ie, Moment 1) of the LTAS may be one acoustic marker sensitive to improvement in dysphonia severity.},

  abstract = {Previous research indicates that talkers differ in phonetically relevant properties of speech, including voice-onset-time (VOT) in word-initial stop consonants; some talkers have characteristically shorter VOTs than others. Previous research also indicates that VOT is robustly affected by contextual influences, including speaking rate and place of articulation. This paper examines whether these contextual influences on VOT are themselves talker-specific. Many tokens of alveolar ∕ti∕ (experiment 1) or labial ∕pi∕ and velar ∕ki∕ (experiment 2) were elicited from talkers across a range of rates. VOT and vowel duration (a metric of rate) were measured for each token. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that (1) VOT increased as rate decreased for all talkers, but the magnitude of the increase varied significantly across talkers; thus the effect of rate on VOT was talker-specific; (2) the talker-specific effect of rate was stable across a change in place of articulation; and (3) for all talkers VOTs were shorter for labial than velar stops, and there was no significant variability in the magnitude of this displacement across talkers; thus the effect of place on VOT was not talker-specific. The implications of these findings for how listeners might accommodate talker differences in VOT during speech perception are discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the speech recognition in noise when using a transparent mask that allows greater visibility of the talker's face compared to an opaque mask in persons with normal and impaired hearing via an online format. DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS: Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9\%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9\%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7\%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Research suggests that people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) do not only suffer from motor but also non-motor impairment. This interdisciplinary study investigated how prominence marking is influenced by problems on the motoric and cognitive level. Materials and methods: We collected speech production data from 38 native German speakers: 19 PwPD (under medication) with a mild to moderate motor impairment, 13 males and 6 females (mean 66.2 years old, SD ¼ 7.7), and 19 healthy age- and gender-matched control participants (mean 65.4 years old, SD ¼ 9.3). Target words were produced in an accented and unaccented condition within a speech production task. The data were analyzed for intensity, syllable duration, F0 and vowel production. Furthermore, we assessed motor impairment and cognitive functions, i.e. working memory, task-switching, attention control and speed of information processing. Results: Both groups were able to mark prominence by increasing pitch, syllable duration and intensity and by adjusting their vowel production. Comparisons between PwPD and control participants revealed that the vowel space was smaller in PwPD even in mildly impaired speakers. Further, task-switching as an executive function, which was tested with the trail making test, was correlated with modulation of F0 and intensity in PwPD: the worse the task-switching performance, the stronger intensity and F0 were modulated (target overshoot). Moreover, motor impairment within the PwPD group was related to a decrease in the acoustic vowel space (target undershoot), which further resulted in a decrease in speech intelligibility and naturalness. This behaviour of target over- and undershoot indicates an inefficient way of prominence marking in PwPD with mildly affected speech. Conclusion: PwPD with signs of mild dysarthria did not differ from the control speakers with respect to their strategies of prominence marking. However, only the PwPD overused F0 and intensity in prominent positions. Overmodulation of F0 and intensity was correlated with the patient’s task-switching ability and reflected ab­ normalities in the regulatory mechanism for expressing prosodic prominence. This is the first study to report a link between cognitive skills and speech production at the phonetic level in PwPD.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates speech changes in Parkinson’s disease on the acoustic and articulatory level with respect to prosodic prominence marking. To display movements of the underlying articulators, speech data from 16 patients with Parkinson’s disease were recorded using electromagnetic articulography. Speech tasks focused on strategies of prominence marking. Patients’ ability to encode prominence in the laryngeal and supra-laryngeal domain is tested in two conditions to examine the influence of motor performance on speech production further: without dopaminergic medication and with dopaminergic medication. The data reveal that patients with Parkinson’s disease are able to highlight important information in both conditions. They maintain prominence relations across- and within-accentuation by adjusting prosodic markers, such as vowel duration and pitch modulation, while the acoustic vowel space remains the same. For differentiating across-accentuation, not only intensity but also all temporal and spatial parameters related to the articulatory tongue body movements during the production of vowels are modulated to signal prominence. In response to the levodopa intake, gross motor performance improved significantly by 42\%. The improvement in gross motor performance was accompanied by an improvement in speech motor performance in terms of louder speech and shorter, larger and faster tongue body movements. The tongue body is more agile under levodopa increase, a fact that is not necessarily detectable on the acoustic level but important for speech therapy.},

  abstract = {This study aims to explore the effects of healthy aging and Parkinson’s disease on speech motor performance. One area of speech production which requires fine speech motor control is prominence marking. Therefore, strategies of prominence marking of three speaker groups with four speakers each were investigated: younger speakers, older speakers, and speakers with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Acoustic and articulatory data were collected. Speech data were analyzed focusing on prominence-related adjustments of vowel production and tongue body movements in the temporal and spatial domain. Longer durations, varying initiation of the tongue movements and smaller vowel sizes in older speakers and in speakers with PD were found compared to younger speakers. The data indicate further that all speaker groups mark prominence by changing relevant parameters in the vowel articulation; however, strategies seem to differ between the groups: (i) in the temporal domain, articulatory movement durations increase with age and are further prolonged in speakers with PD; (ii) in the spatial domain, the articulation space is resized by the older speakers in a non-symmetrical way, while no systematic vocalic modulations were found for speakers with PD. To conclude, the speech system seems to be affected by age and disease, but speakers develop compensatory strategies to counteract influences in the spatial domain.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study evaluated the impact wearing a surgical facemask or N95 air purifying respirator (N95) has on radio reception. METHODS: We compared the ability of a flight crewmember and a layperson sitting in a Bell 407 crew compartment and a dispatcher sitting in a communication center to accurately record 20 randomized aviation terms transmitted over the radio by a helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) pilot wearing a surgical facemask and six different N95s with and without the aircraft engine operating. RESULTS: With the aircraft engine off, all terms (100\% accuracy) were correctly identified, regardless of the absence or presence of the surgical facemask or N95 studied. With the aircraft engine on, the surgical facemask (3M-1826) and two N95 respirators (3M-1860, Safe Life Corp-150) maintained 100\% accuracy. Remaining N95 accuracy was as follows: 3M-8511 and Kimberly-Clark PFR95 (98\%), Inoyel-3212 (97\%), and 3M-1870 (93\%). CONCLUSIONS: In general, despite wearing a facemask, radio reception accuracy is high ({$>$}90\%). However, aircraft engine noise and N95 type do appear to adversely affect the accuracy of radio reception. All HEMS pilots and crewmembers should be aware of these radio reception findings when using an N95 respirator during transport. A brief review of the surgical facemask and N95 effectiveness to prevent viral respiratory infections is provided.},

Method               The primary methodology was computational. The ISO standard 226 was used to convert SPL values to sones for a 125- to 1000-Hz range of fundamental frequency and a –3 dB/octave to –12 dB/octave range of spectral slope. In addition, a retrospective analysis of human subjects' VRPs was conducted, and the experimental results were compared to the theoretical results.                                         Results               A very small range of SPL variation (less than 5 dB) in the VRP can produce a large range of loudness. The sensitivity can be on the order of 4 sones per dB SPL change.                                         Conclusion               For vocalization in the modal register, loudness variation is not well described by SPL change in dB, especially at high fundamental frequencies where the SPL range in the VRP becomes very small but sizeable loudness variations are still possible.},

Improved intelligibility also has been reported. Few studies have directly compared rate and loudness effects for speakers with dysarthria, however, although rate reduction and increasing vocal loudness are common treatment techniques. In the current study, 15 speakers with dysarthria secondary to multiple sclerosis, 12 speakers with dysarthria secondary to Parkinson's disease (PD), and 15 healthy controls read a passage in habitual, loud, and slow conditions. Rate and loudness variations were elicited using magnitude production. Acoustic measures included articulatory rate, sound pressure level, vowel space area, first moment difference measures, and F2 trajectory characteristics for diphthongs. Ten listeners scaled intelligibility for reading passages produced by the speakers with dysarthria. Relationships between intelligibility estimates and acoustic measures were determined by regression analysis. All speaker groups reduced articulatory rate for the slow condition and increased vocal intensity for the loud condition, relative to the habitual condition. Vowel acoustic distinctiveness, as indexed by vowel space area, was maximized in the slow condition, but stop consonant acoustic distinctiveness, as indexed by first moment difference measures, was maximized in the loud condition. F2 slope measures for diphthongs were not consistently affected by rate or loudness. Scaled intelligibility for speakers with PD also improved in the loud condition relative to both the habitual and slow conditions. Intelligibility estimates for speakers with dysarthria, however, were not strongly related to acoustic measures of supraglottal behavior. Findings are compared with previous studies, and hypotheses for future treatment studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that lax vowels may be relatively unaffected by dysarthria, owing to the reduced vocal tract shapes required for these phonetic events (G. S. Turner, K. Tjaden, \& G. Weismer, 1995). It also has been suggested that lax vowels may be especially susceptible to speech mode effects (M. A. Picheny, N. I. Durlach, \& L. D. Braida, 1986). Studies evaluating these suggestions are lacking, however. The present study was an initial investigation of the vowel space area formed by the lax vowels /Iota/, /epsilon/, and /upsilon/, occurring in a passage read in habitual, fast, and slow conditions by speakers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls. Vowel space areas for speakers with ALS but not speakers with PD differed from those for the appropriate control group. Thus, only the results for the PD group support the hypothesis that lax vowel space areas for speakers with dysarthria should be similar to those for neurologically normal talkers. Compared with the habitual condition, rate reduction was associated with an expanded vowel space area for all of the healthy talkers but for only about half of the speakers with dysarthria. In addition, about half of the speakers in each group demonstrated a reduced vowel space area for the fast condition relative to the habitual condition, although the statistical analyses indicated no difference in vowel space areas for the fast and habitual conditions. The current study therefore provides only limited support for the idea that lax vowels are highly susceptible to speech mode effects, at least when the speech modes under consideration include faster-than-normal and slower-than normal rates. Clinical implications are discussed.},

Reduced speech intelligibility is a significant functional limitation of dysarthria, and in the case of PD is likely related articulatory and phonatory impairment. Prosodically-based treatments show the most promise for addressing these deficits as well as for maximizing speech intelligibility. Communication-oriented strategies also may help to enhance mutual understanding between a speaker and listener. Dysphagia in PD can result in serious health issues, including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. Early identification of swallowing abnormalities is critical so as to minimize the impact of dysphagia on health status and quality of life. Feeding modifications, compensatory strategies, and therapeutic swallowing techniques all have a role in the management of dysphagia in PD.}

Perceived severity was operationally defined as listeners’ overall impression of voice, resonance, articulatory precision, and prosody without regard to intelligibility. Healthy control talkers were also studied. Speakers were audio recorded while reading Harvard Sentences and the Grandfather Passage. Using TF32 (), the LTAS was computed for sentences. Coefficients of the first four moments were used to characterize energy across the speech spectrum. Supplemental acoustic measures of articulatory rate, vocal intensity, and fundamental frequency also were obtained. Three speech-language pathologists scaled speech severity for the reading passages. Results indicated no group differences in acoustic measures. The absolute magnitude of correlations between LTAS moment coefficients and perceptual estimates of scaled severity within and across speaker groups ranged from .16 to .53, with the strongest correlations for the PD group. These results suggest that the LTAS may prove useful in conjunction with perceptual judgments to document speech spectral changes related to treatment or disease progression. Findings further suggest that different acoustic models of severity are likely needed for dysarthria secondary to PD and dysarthria secondary to MS.},

Magnitude production was used to elicit variations in rate and loudness. Acoustic measures of duration, intensity and F0 were obtained. Results and Conclu- sions: For all speaker groups, a slower-than-normal articulatory rate and increased vocal loudness had distinct effects on F0 relative to the habitual condition, including a tendency for measures of F0 variation to be greater in the loud condi- tion and reduced in the slow condition. These results sug- gest implications for the treatment of dysarthria.},

The relationship between structural characteristics of utterances and scaled intelligibility was explored within speakers. Speakers were audio-recorded while reading a paragraph and producing a monologue. Speech samples were separated into individual utterances for presentation to 70 listeners who judged intelligibility using orthographic transcription and direct magnitude estimation (DME). Results suggest that scaled estimates of intelligibility for reading show potential for indexing intelligibility of an extemporaneous monologue.

Such a model has the potential to assist in identifying rate control strategies to receive focus in clinical treatment programs and also would advance understanding of global speech timing in dysarthria. All speakers read a passage in Habitual and Slow conditions. Speech rate, articulation rate, pause duration, and pause frequency were measured. All speaker groups adjusted articulation time as well as pause time to reduce overall speech rate. Group differences in how voluntary rate reduction was accomplished were primarily one of quantity or degree. Overall, a slower-than-normal rate was associated with a reduced articulation rate, shorter speech runs that included fewer syllables, and longer more frequent pauses. Taken together, these results suggest that existing skills or strategies used by patients should be emphasized in dysarthria training programs focusing on rate reduction. Results further suggest that a model of voluntary speech rate reduction based on neurologically normal speech shows promise as being applicable for mild to moderate dysarthria.},

  abstract = {Objective: To study the pyramidal tract side effects (PTSEs) induced by the spread of current from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the pyramidal tract (PT), in patients with parkinsonism undergoing STN stimulation. Methods: 14 patients bilaterally implanted with tetrapolar electrodes were assessed. For each side separately, the threshold of adverse effects induced by monopolar stimulation delivered by the chronically used contact was detected. The voltage was progressively increased until the patient experienced discomfort. All the PTSEs induced at 130 Hz (high-frequency stimulation (HFS)) and 2 or 3 Hz (low-frequency stimulation (LFS)) were videotaped. By superimposing the preoperative and postoperative MR images, the minimum distance (R) from the centre of the used contact to the medial border of the PT were measured. Results: The progressive increase in voltage at HFS induced tonic motor contractions, mainly located in the face, in 27/28 electrodes. LFS induced synchronous rhythmic myoclonus in the same territory. PTSEs induced at threshold voltage by HFS were observed in the upper face at 13/28 electrodes (bilaterally in six cases) and in the contralateral lower face at five electrodes. A positive correlation was found between the stimulus intensity capable of eliciting motor contractions at HFS and R. Conclusions: HFS of the STN preferentially activates the corticobulbar tract over the corticospinal tract. Therefore, cranial motor contractions need to be looked for during electrical parameter setting. The positive correlation between the electrical intensity threshold for PTSEs and R reflects the need for millimetre accuracy in electrode positioning.},

  abstract = {Background: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an established treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Speech impairment is a frequent side effect of the surgery. This study examined the efficacy of an intensive speech treatment, the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) on dysarthria after STN-DBS. Methods: The LSVT was administered to 10 patients with STN-DBS (surgical group) and 10 patients without (medical group). Patients were assessed before, immediately after, and 6 months following the speech treatment using sustained phonation, a speech intelligibility scale, and monologue. Vocal loudness, speech intelligibility, and perceptual ratings were the primary outcome measures. Results: Vocal loudness and perceptual scores improved significantly across tasks for the medical group only. Speech intelligibility did not significantly change for either group. Results in the surgical group were variable, with some patients deteriorating. Conclusions: Treatment of dysarthria following STN-DBS needs further investigation because of the variable response to LSVT. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

Thirty-two German native listeners watched video recordings of a native speaker producing German sentences with and without a face mask, and then completed a cued-recall task. Listeners recalled significantly fewer words when the sentences had been spoken with a face mask. This might suggest that face masks increase processing demands, which in turn leaves fewer resources for encoding speech in memory.

Thirty-two German native listeners watched video recordings of a  native speaker producing German sentences with and without a face mask, and then  completed a cued-recall task. Listeners recalled significantly fewer words when the  sentences had been spoken with a face mask. This might suggest that face masks  increase processing demands, which in turn leaves fewer resources for encoding  speech in memory.

It engages with the key question of whether phonological representations are spatio-temporal, as in the Articulatory Phonology approach, or symbolic (atemporal and non-quantitative); this issue has fundamental implications for the architecture of the speech production planning system, particularly with regard to the number of planning components and the type of timing mechanisms. Alice Turk and Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel outline a number of arguments in favour of an alternative to the Articulatory Phonology/Task Dynamics model. They demonstrate that a different framework is needed to account for evidence from speech and non-speech timing behaviour, and specifically that three separate planning components must be posited: Phonological Planning, Phonetic Planning, and Motor-Sensory Implementation. The approach proposed in the book provides a clearer and more comprehensive account of what is known about motor timing in general and speech timing in particular. It will be of interest to phoneticians and phonologists from all theoretical backgrounds as well as to speech clinicians and technologists.},

  abstract = {Predictability is known to affect many properties of speech production. In particular, it has been observed that highly predictable elements (words, syllables) are produced with less phonetic prominence (shorter duration, less peripheral vowels) than less predictable elements. This tendency has been proposed to be a general property of language. This paper examines whether predictability is correlated with fundamental frequency (F0) production, through analysis of experimental corpora of American English. Predictability was variously defined as discourse mention, utterance probability, and semantic focus. The results revealed consistent effects of utterance probability and semantic focus on F0, in the expected direction: less predictable words were produced with a higher F0 than more predictable words. However, no effect of discourse mention was observed. These results provide further empirical support for the generalization that phonetic prominence is inversely related to linguistic predictability. In addition, the divergent results for different predictability measures suggests that the parameterization of predictability within a particular experimental design can have significant impact on the interpretation of results, and that it cannot be assumed that two measures necessarily reflect the same cognitive reality.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a 2-week intensive coordinative motor training on speech production. Speech and motor performances in a cohort of ten individuals with cerebellar degeneration were examined three times; before the introduction of training, directly and 4 weeks after the last training session. Each patient was instructed to perform a speaking task of fast syllable repetition and monologue. Objective acoustic analyses were used to investigate six key aspects of speech production disturbed in ataxic dysarthria including accuracy of consonant articulation, accuracy of vowel articulation, irregular alternating motion rates, prolonged phonemes, slow alternating motion rates and inappropriate segmentation. We found that coordinative training had a mild beneficial effect on speech in cerebellar patients. Immediately after the last training session, slight speech improvements were evident in all ten patients. Furthermore, follow-up assessment performed 4 weeks later revealed that 90\% of the patients showed better speech performance than before initiation of the therapy. The present study supports evidence that the intensive rehabilitative training may positively affect fine-motor movements such as speech in patients with cerebellar ataxia.},

Imprecise consonant articulation was observed across all Parkinsonian groups. Voice onset time of voiceless plosives was more prolonged in both PSP and MSA compared to PD, presumably due to greater severity of dysarthria and slower articulation rate. Voice onset time of voiced plosives was signif- icantly shorter only in MSA, likely as a consequence of damage to cerebellar structures. In agreement with the reduction of pre-voicing, MSA manifested increased number of voiced plosives misclassified as voice- less at perceptual evaluation. Timing of articulatory movements may provide important clues about the pathophysiology of underlying disease.},

  abstract = {Acoustical measures of vocal function are routinely used in the assessments of disordered voice, and for monitoring the patient's progress over the course of voice therapy. Typically, acoustic measures are extracted from sustained vowel stimuli where short-term and long-term perturbations in fundamental frequency and intensity, and the level of “glottal noise” are used to characterize the vocal function. However, acoustic measures extracted from continuous speech samples may well be required for accurate prediction of abnormal voice quality that is relevant to the client's “real world” experience. In contrast with sustained vowel research, there is relatively sparse literature on the effectiveness of acoustic measures extracted from continuous speech samples. This is partially due to the challenge of segmenting the speech signal into voiced, unvoiced, and silence periods before features can be extracted for vocal function characterization. In this paper we propose a joint time-frequency approach for classifying pathological voices using continuous speech signals that obviates the need for such segmentation. The speech signals were decomposed using an adaptive time-frequency transform algorithm, and several features such as the octave max, octave mean, energy ratio, length ratio, and frequency ratio were extracted from the decomposition parameters and analyzed using statistical pattern classification techniques. Experiments with a database consisting of continuous speech samples from 51 normal and 161 pathological talkers yielded a classification accuracy of 93.4\%.}

Prior studies have revealed the adverse effects (AEs) of PPE on healthcare workers (HCWs); however, no review has focused on the AEs of PPE on HCWs in intensive care units (ICUs). This review aimed to identify the AEs of PPE on HCWs working in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsA scoping review was conducted. MEDLINE, CINAHL, the World Health Organization (WHO) global literature on COVID-19, and Igaku-chuo-zasshi (a Japanese medical database), Google Scholar, medRxiv, and Health Research Board (HRB) open research were searched from January 25?28, 2021. The extracted data included author(s) name, year of publication, country, language, article title, journal name, publication type, study methodology, population, outcome, and key findings.ResultsThe initial search identified 691 articles and abstracts. Twenty-five articles were included in the analysis. The analysis comprised four key topics: studies focusing on PPE-related headache, voice disorders, skin manifestations, and miscellaneous AEs of PPE. The majority of AEs for HCWs in ICUs were induced by prolonged use of masks.ConclusionThe AEs of PPE among HCWs in ICUs included heat, headaches, skin injuries, chest discomfort, and dyspnea. Studies with a focus on specific diseases were on skin injuries. Moreover, many AEs were induced by prolonged use of masks.},

  abstract = {Purpose               This exploratory study sought to identify acoustic variables explaining rate-related variation in intelligibility for speakers with dysarthria secondary to multiple sclerosis.                                         Method                                Seven speakers with dysarthria due to multiple sclerosis produced the same set of Harvard sentences at habitual and slow rates. Speakers were selected from a larger corpus on the basis of rate-related intelligibility characteristics. Four speakers demonstrated improved intelligibility and three speakers demonstrated reduced intelligibility when rate was slowed. A speech analysis resynthesis paradigm termed                 hybridization                 was used to create stimuli in which segmental (i.e., short-term spectral) and suprasegmental variables (i.e., sentence-level fundamental frequency, energy characteristics, and duration) of sentences produced at the slow rate were donated individually or in combination to habitually produced sentences. Online crowdsourced orthographic transcription was used to quantify intelligibility for six hybridized sentence types and the original habitual and slow productions.                                                        Results               Sentence duration alone was not a contributing factor to improved intelligibility associated with slowed rate. Speakers whose intelligibility improved with slowed rate showed higher intelligibility scores for duration spectrum hybrids and energy hybrids compared to the original habitual rate sentences, suggesting these acoustic cues contributed to improved intelligibility for sentences produced with a slowed rate. Energy contour characteristics were also found to play a role in intelligibility losses for speakers with decreased intelligibility at slowed rate. The relative contribution of speech acoustic variables to intelligibility gains and losses varied considerably between speakers.                                         Conclusions               Hybridization can be used to identify acoustic correlates of intelligibility variation associated with slowed rate. This approach has further elucidated speaker-specific and individualized speech production adjustments when slowing rate.},

Through this case study, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework: researchers can (i) flexibly define the underlying process that they believe to have generated the data; (ii) obtain direct information regarding the uncertainty about the parameter that relates the data to the theoretical question being studied; and (iii) incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis. Getting started with Bayesian modeling can be challenging, especially when one is trying to model one’s own (often unique) data. It is difficult to see how one can apply general principles described in textbooks to one’s own specific research problem. We address this barrier to using Bayesian methods by providing three detailed examples, with source code to allow easy reproducibility. The examples presented are intended to give the reader a flavor of the process of model-fitting; suggestions for further study are also provided.

We propose a method based on multi-view representation learning via generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) for learn- ing a representation of features extracted from handwriting and gait that can be used as a complement to speech–based features. Three different problems are addressed: classi- fication of PD patients vs. healthy controls, prediction of the neurological state of PD patients according to the UP- DRS score, and the prediction of a modified version of the Frenchay dysarthria assessment (m-FDA). According to the results, the proposed approach is suitable to improve the re- sults in the addressed problems, specially in the prediction of the UPDRS, and m-FDA scores.},

  abstract = {Recent influential models of audiovisual speech perception suggest that visual speech aids perception by generating predictions about the identity of upcoming speech sounds. These models place stock in the assumption that visual speech leads auditory speech in time. However, it is unclear whether and to what extent temporally-leading visual speech information contributes to perception. Previous studies exploring audiovisual-speech timing have relied upon psychophysical procedures that require artificial manipulation of cross-modal alignment or stimulus duration. We introduce a classification procedure that tracks perceptually relevant visual speech information in time without requiring such manipulations. Participants were shown videos of a McGurk syllable (auditory /apa/ + visual /aka/ = perceptual /ata/) and asked to perform phoneme identification (/apa/ yes-no). The mouth region of the visual stimulus was overlaid with a dynamic transparency mask that obscured visual speech in some frames but not others randomly across trials. Variability in participants’ responses ( 35 \% identification of /apa/ compared to 5 \% in the absence of the masker) served as the basis for classification analysis. The outcome was a high resolution spatiotemporal map of perceptually relevant visual features. We produced these maps for McGurk stimuli at different audiovisual temporal offsets (natural timing, 50-ms visual lead, and 100-ms visual lead). Briefly, temporally-leading ( 130 ms) visual information did influence auditory perception. Moreover, several visual features influenced perception of a single speech sound, with the relative influence of each feature depending on both its temporal relation to the auditory signal and its informational content.

The results of the acoustic analysis showed a decline in f0 variation towards the end of the time period. The results of the perceptual experiment demonstrated that listeners rated the later recordings as less healthy relative to the earlier ones. Listeners’ experience with speech disorders influenced the trend, which was more pronounced for the experienced listeners compared to the listeners with no prior experience with speech disorders.},

  abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder char­ acterized by several motor and non-motor manifestations. PD fre­ quently leads to hypokinetic dysarthria, which affects speech production and often has a detrimental impact on everyday commu­ nication. Among the typical manifestations of hypokinetic dysarthria, speech and language therapists (SLTs) identify prosody as the most affected cluster of speech characteristics. However, less is known about how untrained listeners perceive PD speech and how affected prosody influences their assessments of speech. This study explores the perception of sentence type intonation and healthiness of PD speech by listeners with different levels of familiarity with speech disorders in Dutch. We investigated assessments and classification accuracy differences between Dutch-speaking SLTs (n = 18) and Dutch/non-Dutch speaking untrained listeners (n = 27 and n = 124, respectively). We collected speech data from 30 Dutch speakers diag­ nosed with PD and 30 Dutch healthy controls. The stimuli set consisted of short phrases from spontaneous and read speech and of phrases produced with different sentence type intonation. Listeners partici­ pated in an online experiment targeting classification of sentence type intonation and perceived healthiness of speech. Results indicate that both familiarity with speech disorders and with speakers’ language are significant and have different effects depending on the task type, as different listener groups demonstrate different classification accuracy. There is evidence that untrained Dutch listeners classify PD speech as unhealthy more accurately than both trained Dutch and untrained non-Dutch listeners, while trained Dutch listeners outperform the other two groups in sentence type classification.},

  abstract = {The growth of the vocal tract (VT) is known to be non-uniform insofar as there are regional differences in anatomic maturation. This study presents quantitative anatomic data on the growth of the oral and pharyngeal portions of the VT from 605 imaging studies for individuals between birth and 19 years. The oral (horizontal) portion of the VT was segmented into lip-thickness, anterior-cavity-length, oropharyngeal-width, and VT-oral; and the pharyngeal (vertical) portion of the VT into posterior-cavity-length, and nasopharyngeal-length. The data were analyzed to determine growth trend, growth rate and growth type (neural or somatic). Findings indicate differences in the growth trend of segments/variables analyzed, with significant sex differences for all variables except anterior-cavity-length. While the growth trend of some variables display prepubertal sex differences at specific age ranges, the importance of such localized differences appears to be masked by overall growth rate differences between males and females. Finally, assessment of growth curve type indicates that most VT structures follow a combined/hybrid (somatic and neural) growth curve with structures in the vertical plane having a predoMinantly somatic growth pattern. these data on the non-uniform growth of the vocal tract reveal anatomic differences that contribute to documented acoustic differences in prepubertal speech production.},

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary referral center between July and September 2020. A female talker recorded sentences in three conditions: no face covering, N95 mask, and N95 mask plus a face shield. Spectral differences were analyzed between speech produced in each condition. The speech recognition in each condition for twenty-three adult patients with at least 6 months of cochlear implant use was assessed. RESULTS: Spectral analysis demonstrated preferential attenuation of high-frequency speech information with the N95 mask plus face shield condition compared to the other conditions. Speech recognition did not differ significantly between the uncovered (median 90\% [IQR 89\%-94\%]) and N95 mask conditions (91\% [IQR 86\%-94\%]; P = .253); however, speech recognition was significantly worse in the N95 mask plus face shield condition (64\% [IQR 48\%-75\%]) compared to the uncovered (P {$<$} .001) or N95 mask (P {$<$} .001) conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The type and combination of protective face coverings used have differential effects on attenuation of speech information, influencing speech recognition of patients with hearing loss.

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that lesions of the basal ganglia frequently result in dysarthria, in part because many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired speech. Earlier studies of speech production in PD using perceptual, acoustic, and/or kinematic analyses have yielded mixed findings about the characteristics of articulatory movements underlying hypokinetic dysarthria associated with PD: in some cases reporting reduced articulatory output, and in other instances revealing orofacial movement parameters within the normal range. The central aim of this experiment was to address these inconsistencies by providing an integrative description of basic kinematic and acoustic parameters of speech production in individuals with PD. Recordings of lip and jaw movements and acoustic data were collected in 16 individuals with PD and 16 age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy older adults. Our results revealed a downscaling of articulatory dynamics in the individuals with PD, evidenced by decreased amplitude and velocity of lower lip and jaw movements, decreased vocal intensity (dB sound pressure level [SPL]), and reduced second formant (F2) slopes. However, speech rate did not differ between groups. Our finding of an overall downscaling of speech movement and acoustic parameters in some participants with PD provides support for speech therapies directed at increasing speech effort in individuals with PD.},

  abstract = {The speech of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically characterized as lacking in proper prosody because of its monopitch and monoloud quality, in addition to its reduced intensity. These qualities make it difficult for others to understand speakers with PD. The purpose of the current study was to identify what individuals with PD would do vocally, if anything at all, to improve speech production following a simulated misunderstanding of what they had just said. The study evaluated the performance of 5 individuals with PD and compared their performance to 5 age- and sex-matched controls. Specifically, measures of vocal intensity (loudness), fundamental frequency (pitch), and utterance duration were made for repetitions of a `misheard' phrase. In one experimental condition noise was presented through headphones to induce the Lombard effect. Both individuals with PD and controls used increased duration as a means of enhancing clarity in a repetition. Fundamental frequency (F0) and sound pressure level (SPL) were not consistently modified in repetitions for clarification. Under most speaking conditions, individuals with PD and controls had similar F0 and SPL. Individuals with PD, like the controls, responded to the presentation of masking noise by increasing their fundamental frequency and their intensity. Therefore, not all individuals with PD exhibit difficulty using prosody.},

In this chapter, evidence from three sets of experiments suggests that emphasis is the product of a number of different factors that can affect the acoustic prominence of a word in different ways. I present evidence that (1) emphasis can vary continuously, not categorically; (2) differing factors like difficulty of production and informational importance have different effects on how emphasis is acoustically realized; and (3) listeners do not treat all acoustic correlates of emphasis equally when processing speech, suggesting that they are sensitive to the fact that emphasis is the product of multiple sources. These findings suggest that rather than being a unitary linguistic or psychological construct, emphasis is the product of an array of different cognitive and linguistic factors.},

To investigate whether these factors are independent or two aspects of the same phenomenon, na¨ıve participants played a verbal variant of Tic Tac Toe. Both importance and predictability contributed independently to the acoustic prominence of a word, but in different ways. Predictable game moves were shorter in duration and had less pitch excursion than less predictable game moves, whereas intensity was higher for important game moves. These data also suggest that acoustic prominence is affected by both speaker-centered processes (speaker effort) and listener-centered processes (intent to signal important information to the listener).},

However, the degree and type of phonetic similarity between competitors which induces hyperarticulation remains unclear. Here, we compared neighborhood density (as a representative of a phonetically-general type of similarity) to the existence of a phonetic cue-specific lexical minimal pair in terms of their ability to predict hyperarticulation of two different cue-types in a corpus of natural English speech. For all phonetic cues that we investigated – word-initial voiceless stop VOT, word-initial voiced stop VOT, and vowel-vowel Euclidean formant distance – cue-specific minimal pair existence significantly predicted cue hyperarticulation, while neighborhood density did not. Further, the direction of change in a phonetic cue was found not to be consistent within a given cue-type, but instead varied as a function of the phonetic relationship, creating greater phonetic distance to the competitor. For tokens of word-initial voiceless stops, existence of a voiced-stop minimal pair predicted significantly longer VOT, while for word-initial voiced stops, existence of a voiceless-stop minimal pair predicted a shorter VOT. For tokens of vowels, existence of a minimal pair defined by a nearby vowel predicted greater Euclidean distance in formant space from that vowel, rather than greater expansion of the vowel space per se. For example, lax vowels in words with a more peripheral vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., ship ∼ sheep) were relatively centralized, while tense vowels in words with a more interior vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., date ∼ debt) were relatively peripheralized.},

  abstract = {Purpose       Telepractice improves patient access to clinical care for voice disorders. Acoustic          assessment has the potential to provide critical, objective information during telepractice,          yet its validity via telepractice is currently unknown. The current study investigated          the accuracy of acoustic measures of voice in a variety of telepractice platforms.              Method       Twenty-nine voice samples from individuals with dysphonia were transmitted over six          video conferencing platforms (Zoom with and without enhancements, Cisco WebEx, Microsoft          Teams, Doxy.me, and VSee Messenger). Standard time-, spectral-, and cepstral-based          acoustic measures were calculated. The effect of transmission condition on each acoustic          measure was assessed using repeated-measures analyses of variance. For those acoustic          measures for which transmission condition was a significant factor, linear regression          analysis was performed on the difference between the original recording and each telepractice          platform, with the overall severity of dysphonia, Internet speed, and ambient noise          from the transmitter as predictors.              Results       Transmission condition was a statistically significant factor for all acoustic measures          except for mean fundamental frequency (fo). Ambient noise from the transmitter was a significant predictor of differences between          platforms and the original recordings for all acoustic measures except fo measures. All telepractice platforms affected acoustic measures in a statistically          significantly manner, although the effects of platforms varied by measure.              Conclusions       Overall, measures of fo were the least impacted by telepractice transmission. Microsoft Teams had the least          and Zoom (with enhancements) had the most pronounced effects on acoustic measures.          These results provide valuable insight into the relative validity of acoustic measures          of voice when collected via telepractice.

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate measures of speech production that could be used to document effects of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) on speech performance, especially in persons with Parkinson disease (PD). A small set of evaluative criteria for these measures is presented first, followed by consideration of several speech physiology and speech acoustic measures that have been studied frequently and reported on in the literature on normal speech production, and speech production affected by neuromotor disorders (dysarthria). Each measure is reviewed and evaluated against the evaluative criteria. Embedded within this review and evaluation is a presentation of new data relating speech motions to speech intelligibility measures in speakers with PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and control speakers (CS). These data are used to support the conclusion that at the present time the slope of second formant transitions (F2 slope), an acoustic measure, is well suited to make inferences to speech motion and to predict speech intelligibility. The use of other measures should not be ruled out, however, and we encourage further development of evaluative criteria for speech measures designed to probe the effects of DBS or any treatment with potential effects on speech production and communication skills.}

The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  n2 = {Objectives: Slowed speaking rate was examined for its effects on speech intelligibility, its interaction with the benefit of contextual cues, and the impact of these factors on listening effort in adults with cochlear implants. Design: Participants (n = 21 cochlear implant users) heard high- and low-context sentences that were played at the original speaking rate, as well as a slowed (1.4× duration) speaking rate, using uniform pitch-synchronous time warping. In addition to intelligibility measures, changes in pupil dilation were measured as a time-varying index of processing load or listening effort. Slope of pupil size recovery to baseline after the sentence was used as an index of resolution of perceptual ambiguity. Results: Speech intelligibility was better for high-context compared to low-context sentences and slightly better for slower compared to original-rate speech. Speech rate did not affect magnitude and latency of peak pupil dilation relative to sentence offset. However, baseline pupil size recovered more substantially for slower-rate sentences, suggesting easier processing in the moment after the sentence was over. The effect of slowing speech rate was comparable to changing a sentence from low context to high context. The effect of context on pupil dilation was not observed until after the sentence was over, and one of two analyses suggested that context had greater beneficial effects on listening effort when the speaking rate was slower. These patterns maintained even at perfect sentence intelligibility, suggesting that correct speech repetition does not guarantee efficient or effortless processing. With slower speaking rates, there was less variability in pupil dilation slopes following the sentence, implying mitigation of some of the difficulties shown by individual listeners who would otherwise demonstrate prolonged effort after a sentence is heard. Conclusions: Slowed speaking rate provides release from listening effort when hearing an utterance, particularly relieving effort that would have lingered after a sentence is over. Context arguably provides even more release from listening effort when speaking rate is slower. The pattern of prolonged pupil dilation for faster speech is consistent with increased need to mentally correct errors, although that exact interpretation cannot be verified with intelligibility data alone or with pupil data alone. A pattern of needing to dwell on a sentence to disambiguate misperceptions likely contributes to difficulty in running conversation where there are few opportunities to pause and resolve recently heard utterances.

The main aim of this study was to characterize the phonoarticulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and correlate it with clinical and genetic factors. Thirty-one patients with SCA3 who were subjected to spontaneous speech recordings and phonoarticulatory diadochokinesis (DDK) participated in the study. Speech analyses were performed starting after 10 s of spontaneous speech, by three experienced speech therapists, using a protocol for dysarthria adapted from the Mayo Clinic. The intra-evaluator reliability was analyzed. The lower the patient's age at disease onset was, the more frequent the occurrences of monofrequency and altered speech rhythm were. Articulation, DDK, resonance, and prosody showed a moderate correlation with the number of “CAG” triplet repeats. We conclude that the phonoarticulation of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is characterized by mixed dysarthrophonia with cerebellar and hypokinetic components, and that there is a tendency toward higher frequency of dysarthrophonia symptoms with lower age of disease onset, longer time since onset and higher number of “CAG” triplet repeats.},

However, a limited number of studies have investigated lingual function during speech production in this population. This study aimed to investigate lingual kinematics during speech production using electromagnetic articulography (AG-200 EMA). The PD group consisted of eight dysarthric speakers with PD and was matched with a group of eight controls. The tongue tip and tongue back movements of all participants during sentence production were recorded by EMA. Results showed that, perceptually, the participants with PD were mildly dysarthric. Kinematic results documented comparable (for alveolar sentence production) and increased (for velar sentence production) range of lingual movement in the PD group when compared to the control group. Lingual movement velocity, acceleration, and deceleration were also increased in the PD group, predominantly for the release phase of consonant production during sentence utterances. The PD group had longer duration in the production of alveolar consonant and comparable duration in the production of velar consonant. The results of the present study suggest the presence of impaired lingual control in individuals with PD. Increased range of articulatory movement, primarily in the release phase of consonant production, may account for articulatory imprecision in this population.},

The present study aimed to compare lingual kinematics during consonant production within a sentence in eight dysarthric (DPD) and seven nondysarthric (NDPD) speakers with PD with those of eleven nonneurologically impaired normal participants. The tongue tip and tongue back movements of the participants during sentence production were recorded using electromagnetic articulography (EMA). Results showed that both the DPD and NDPD had deviant articulatory movement during consonant production that resulted in longer duration of consonant production. When compared with the NDPD group, the DPD group primarily exhibited increased range of lingual movement and compatible duration of production with an accompanying increase in maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, and maximum deceleration. These findings are contrary to proposed theories that suggest articulatory imprecision in dysarthric speakers with PD is the outcome of reduced range of articulatory movement.},

An intraclass correlation approach was used to explicitly partition the “error free” between-subject variance and measurement error variance across repeated days (2) and across repeated trials (5). Ten healthy adults served as controls and 30 patients with diagnoses of multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, or Parkinson's disease served as subjects. The intraclass correlation analyses revealed generally high reliability (R greater than .90) for upper and lower lip force measurements, for various combinations of control and/or patient groups, and within each individual patient group. There was moderate correspondence between the quantitative measures of lip force and the clinical assessment of combined upper (r = .67) and lower lip closure force (r = .62) but low correspondence between the quantitative measures of lip force and the presence of motor speech deficit. The lower lip force of patients with Parkinson's disease (M = 3.1 N) on Day 1 was markedly reduced from that of all other patient groups and controls (M = 10.1 N). These results yield helpful information for the design of investigations of oral-motor weakness and for the quantitative assessment of an individual's clinical status.},

Within- and across-language comparisons of the collected data revealed considerable variation in vocal tract length between male and female speakers and between Korean and American English speakers. For a more precise comparison, the variation was drastically reduced by applying uniform scaling within and across the two languages. In the cross-language comparison of the normalized data, which were converted to a perceptual dimension, it is argued that adaptive dispersion is operating within a language’s system of contrasts to fulfill a condition of sufficient contrast.t-tests were conducted on those vowels transcribed using the same or similar IPA symbols in the two languages to assess the statistical significance of those comparisons.},

In this study, there was no significant difference between the control group and the clinical group in the lowfrequency region (boys: 0–2720 Hz; girls: 0–2240 Hz). LTAS measurements showed a great difference between the control group and the clinical group in the middle-frequency region (boys: 2720–4000 Hz; girls: 2240–4000 Hz). We also found that the energy distributed in the clinical group was lower than that of the control group in the highfrequency region (4000 Hz–8000 Hz) in both boys and girls. Conclusions. The results reveal a lack of flat region in the middle-frequency range in the clinical group (both boys and girls) in comparison with the control group. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference across the control group and the clinical group in the low-frequency region.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the recommended/required use of face masks in public. The use of a face mask compromises communication, especially in the presence of competing noise. It is crucial to measure the potential effects of wearing face masks on speech intelligibility in noisy environments where excessive background noise can create communication challenges. The effects of wearing transparent face masks and using clear speech to facilitate better verbal communication were evaluated in this study. We evaluated listener word identification scores in the following four conditions: (1) type of mask condition (i.e., no mask, transparent mask, and disposable face mask), (2) presentation mode (i.e., auditory only and audiovisual), (3) speaking style (i.e., conversational speech and clear speech), and (4) with two types of background noise (i.e., speech shaped noise and four-talker babble at −5 signal-to-noise ratio). Results indicate that in the presence of noise, listeners performed less well when the speaker wore a disposable face mask or a transparent mask compared to wearing no mask. Listeners correctly identified more words in the audiovisual presentation when listening to clear speech. Results indicate the combination of face masks and the presence of background noise negatively impact speech intelligibility for listeners. Transparent masks facilitate the ability to understand target sentences by providing visual information. Use of clear speech was shown to alleviate challenging communication situations including compensating for a lack of visual cues and reduced acoustic signals.},

  abstract = {Although diversity of symptoms and urgency of needs pose many challenges, management of the degenerative dysarthrias is a crucial aspect of clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to review current research literature on selected degenerative dysarthrias including those associated with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These dysarthrias are prevalent yet represent distinct patterns of underlying neuropathology, symptoms, age of onset, and rate of progression. Literature searches including the period 1997–2006 yielded 148 different studies reporting data on communication issues related to dysarthria. By far the largest category of studies was that which provided a basic description of speech production including the neurophysiologic, acoustic, or perceptual properties of dysarthria. Other categories included management (assessment and treatment) and the psychosocial consequences of dysarthria. While the topic of management of degenerative dysarthria is a focused one, it provides a window into many issues critical to the field of communication disorders including fundamental properties of speech production, development of evidence-based treatment techniques, the staging of these techniques into an effective management sequence, and the psychosocial consequences of communication disorders along with techniques to maintain communicative participation in the face of degenerative conditions.},

Thirty-two college students performed the following intelligibility quantification tasks: percentage estimates, rating scale estimates, work and sentence transcriptions, word and sentence completions, and word and sentence multiple-choice tasks. Intelligibility scores for transcriptions were compared to estimates and to other objective tasks with the following results: (1) all measurement techniques, except word completion, rank ordered speakers similarly to transcriptions, (2) mean estimates of intelligibility closely parallel transcription scores, but dispersion of listener estimates was large, and (3) objective tasks form a hierarchy with speakers receiving lowest scores on transcriptions, intermediate scores on completions, and highest scores on multiple-choice tasks. Mean scores for words and sentences were similar. Implications of results for clinical management of dysarthria are discussed.},

Increases in intelligibility were initially achieved by control of speaking rate. A hierarchy of rate control strategies, ranging from a rigid imposition of rate through thythmic cueing to self-monitored rate control is discussed. As speakers improved their monitoring skills, a compromise was made between intelligibility and rate. Normal prosodic patterns were not achieved by the ataxic speakers due to difficulty in precisely coordinating the subtle fundamental frequency, loudness and timing adjustments needed to signal stress. Three of the four subjects were taught to use only durational adjustments to signal stress. In this way, they were able to achieve stress on targeted words consistently and minimize bizarreness which resulted from sweeping changes in fundamental frequency and bursts of loudness. The need for further clinically oriented research is discussed.},

Effects of rate control on sentence and phoneme intelligibility and speech naturalness were examined. Sentence intelligibility improved for both groups, with metered pacing conditions associated with the largest improvement in scores. Similar improvements as speaking rates were reduced were not seen for the phoneme intelligibility task; however, one must recognize that sentence and phoneme intelligibility tasks are different. Slowing the rate of dysarthric speakers did not have as marked an impact on speech naturalness as it did for normal speakers whose naturalness decreased at slowed rates. Metered rate control strategies were associated with the lowest ratings of naturalness for all subject groups. A potential explanation for the discrepancies between the findings for sentence and phoneme intelligibility is offered.},

  abstract = {This study presents the first acoustic examination of prominence relations in entire contours associated with different information structures in Egyptian Arabic. Previous work has shown that topics and foci are typically associated with different pitch events, whereas it is still a matter of debate whether and how Egyptian Arabic uses prominence relations to mark narrow focus. The analysis of data from 17 native speakers showed that narrow focus was marked by on-focus pitch expansion as well as post-focus compression. Post-focus compression was realized as a large downstep after focus, compressed pitch range, lower intensity and shorter duration. The results also showed further register lowering after a contrastive focus, but no further pitch boost of the focused word. By contrast, a contrastive topic showed higher scaling of the topic as well as an expanded pitch range of the overall contour. The findings of this study stress the significance of whole contours to convey intonational meanings, revealing gradient prominence cues to focus across the utterance, specifically post-focus register lowering to enhance the prominence of a contrastive focus.},
