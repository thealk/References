  abstract = {Methods. Twelve healthy older adults (six females) produced a sentence containing an embedded Stroop task in each of two cognitive load conditions: congruent and incongruent. Three physiologic measures of autonomic arousal (pulse volume amplitude, pulse period, and skin conductance response amplitude) and four acoustic measures of voice (cepstral peak prominence, low-to-high spectral energy ratio, fundamental frequency, and sound pressure level) were analyzed in each cognitive load condition. Results. A logistic regression model was used to predict the cognitive load condition using participant as a categorical predictor and the four acoustic measures and three autonomic measures as continuous predictors. Skin conductance response amplitude and pulse volume amplitude were both predictive of cognitive load; however, no acoustic measures of voice were statistically significant predictors of cognitive load for older adults. Conclusions. These findings support the idea that increased cognitive load is associated with increased autonomic nervous system activity in older adults. The lack of changes in acoustic measures of voice with increased cognitive load may result from age-related changes in vocal quality and speech subsystems.},

  abstract = {Twelve patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease had acoustic speech analysis of sentence utterances to provide information on speech tempo and accuracy of articulation. As a measure of rate of speech the duration of opening-closing movements during articulation was determined from speech wave variables. The intensity of sound emission during articulatory closure as required for stop consonant production, for example, magnitude of p, magnitude of t, magnitude of k, was used as an index of the degree of closure. Speech tempo was not significantly different from normal. The patients, however, had a reduced capacity of completing articulatory occlusion. This was interpreted as reflecting a reduction in movement amplitude of the articulators. Articulatory “undershoot” was not uniform but influenced by linguistic demands in that the closures associated with a stressed syllable were performed at the expense of unstressed ones. Furthermore, switching between opening and closing movements of the articulators in sentence production seemed undisturbed. These results indicate that motor planning of speech differs from arm movement control.},

  abstract = {The various components of the central motor system are expected to play a similar role in speech production and in upper limb control. Slowed articulatory performance, therefore, must be expected in disorders of the corticobulbar tracts, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. Using an optoelectronic device, the present study recorded lower lip trajectories during production of sentence utterances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), cerebellar atrophy (CA), and pseudobulbar palsy (PB). The various subject groups showed a similar range of overall motor disability. Patients with CA and PB exhibited slowed movement execution in terms of a reduced ratio of peak velocity to maximum amplitude (“stiffness”). In contrast to upper limb motor control, the lip excursions showed an uncompromised shape of velocity profiles. Two different patterns emerged in HD. A single patient suffering from the akinetic-rigid Westphal variant of this disease had articulatory hypometria, whereas the remaining subjects showed significant bradykinesia under increased temporal demands, concomitant with normal movement amplitudes. The PD patients had unimpaired velocity-displacement relationships. Presumably, biomechanical constraints such as the rather small excursions of articulatory lower lip gestures or the scarce spindle supply of facial muscles account for the observed discrepancies between upper limb and speech motor control in PD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study reports on experiments designed to examine the effects of a variably occluded face mask (VOFM) on (a) estimated subglottal pressure (Psub) in normophonic participants and (b) aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of voice in dysphonic participants. DESIGN: A prospective design was used for experiment 1, and a prospective, randomized cohort design was used for experiment 2. METHODS: The outlet ports of disposable anesthesia face masks were fitted with plastic caps with variable diameter drilled openings (9.6, 6.4, 3.2, and 1.6\,mm) to create a series of mask openings. In experiment 1, Psub was measured in normophonic participants using the face mask during syllable repetitions in unoccluded and variable diameter opening conditions. In experiment 2, aerodynamic and acoustic measures were obtained in a group of dysphonic speakers before and after syllable and speech repetition tasks using the VOFM. RESULTS: In experiment 1, mean PSub was observed to decrease while using the VOFM in all occlusion conditions versus nonocclusion, with a significant reduction in Psub observed between the baseline and the 6.4\,mm condition. In experiment 2, standardized mean differences showed that many dysphonic participants produced reduced Psub, increased airflow, and improved acoustic measures after the use of the VOFM in at least one occlusion condition. CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial changes in both aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of voice may be obtained in dysphonic speakers using a VOFM. By moving the place of occlusion outside of the oral cavity, therapeutic stimuli options may be extended beyond vowel and humming elicitations to syllable and speech contexts and assist with generalization of voice therapy targets to conversational speech.},

  abstract = {The language redundancy of a syllable, measured by its predictability given its context and inherent frequency, has been shown to have a strong inverse relationship with syllabic duration. This relationship is predicted by the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis, which proposes that robust communication in a noisy environment can be achieved with an inverse relationship between language redundancy and the predictability given acoustic observations (acoustic redundancy). A general version of the hypothesis predicts similar relationships between the spectral characteristics of speech and language redundancy. However, investigating this claim is hampered by difficulties in measuring the spectral characteristics of speech within large conversational corpora, and difficulties in forming models of acoustic redundancy based on these spectral characteristics. This paper addresses these difficulties by testing the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis with a very high-quality corpus collected for speech synthesis, and presents both durational and spectral data from vowel nuclei on a vowel-by-vowel basis. Results confirm the duration/ language redundancy results achieved in previous work, and show a significant relationship between language redundancy factors and the first two formants, although these results vary considerably by vowel. In general, however, vowels show increased centralization with increased language redundancy.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Traditionally, deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders (MDs) is provided using stimulation frequencies equal to or above 100 Hz. However, recent evidence suggests that rela- tively low-frequency stimulation (LFS) below 100 Hz is an option to treat some patients with MDs. Objectives: We aimed to review the clinical and pathophysiological evidence supporting the use of stimulation frequencies below 100 Hz in different MDs. Results: Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus at 60 Hz has provided benefit in gait and other axial symptoms such as swallowing and speech. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus between 20 and 45 Hz can provide benefit in freezing of gait, cognition, and sleep quality in select patients with Par- kinson's disease. Stimulation of the globus pallidus internus below 100 Hz in patients with dystonia has provided benefit at the beginning of the therapy, although progressively higher stimulation frequencies seem to be necessary to maintain the clinical benefit. Relative LFS can lower energy requirements and reduce battery usageda useful feature, particularly in patients treated with high current energy. Conclusions: DBS at frequencies below 100 Hz is a therapeutic option in select cases of Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait and other axial symptoms, and in select patients with dystonia and other hyperkinetic movements, particularly those requiring an energy-saving strategy.},

The design of the HCRC Map Task enables us to do so. We examine two ‘tailoring’ changes in repeated mentions of landmark names: faster articulation and simplified referring expressions. Articulation results replicate Bard et al. (2000), depending only on what the speaker has heard. Change between mentions was no greater when it could be inferred that the listener could see the named item (Expt 1), and no less when the listener explicitly denied ability to do so (Expt 2). Word duration fell for speakerGiven listener-New items (Expt 3). Reduction was unaffected by the repeater’s ability to see the mentioned landmark (Expt 4). In contrast, referential form was more sensitive to both listener- (Expt 3) and speakerknowledge (Expt 4). The results conform most closely to a Dual Process model: fast, automatic, processes let the speaker-knowledge prime word articulation, while costly assessments of listener-knowledge influence only referential form.},

As manual segmentation is a lengthy and tedious task, automatic procedures have been developed over the years. They rely on acoustic Hidden Markov Models. Many studies have been conducted, and refinements developed for corpus based speech synthesis, where the technology is mainly used in a speaker-dependent context and applied on good quality speech signals. In a different research direction, automatic speech-text alignment is also used for phonetic and linguistic studies on large speech corpora. In this case, speaker independent acoustic models are mandatory, and the speech quality may not be so good. The speech models rely on 10 ms shift between acoustic frames, and their topology leads to strong minimum duration constraints. This paper focuses on the acoustic analysis frame rate, and gives a first insight on the impact of the frame rate on corpus-based phonetic studies.},

Dysarthria is a pervasive symptom of Friedreich's ataxia, yet the clinical presentation of speech symptoms remains poorly understood, leaving clinicians without the evidence required to develop therapy interventions. The research reported herein had three aims: the first was to document the severity of the intelligibility deficit associated with Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria; the second was to document the phonetic profile of the intelligibility deficit; and the third was to use the results of the phonetic profile to estimate the motor control mechanisms and neurological substrates implicated in Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria. Eleven adult males with Friedreich's ataxia were recruited. Intelligibility was assessed using a single-word multiple-choice task completed by ten listeners. Intelligibility severity ratings ranged from mild to severe. The majority of subjects fell into the mild category. The phonetic errors revealed a distinctive profile, with word-final plosive voicing contrast representing the highest source of error. Involvement of cerebro-cerebellar loops was considered to be compatible with the profile results. Friedreich's ataxia dysarthria has a distinctive phonetic profile and contains subgroups of different severity. High sources of error identified in the phonetic profile should be considered when developing targets for therapy intervention. Neurological substrates are considered to vary across individuals and to include involvement of cerebro-cerebellar loops. Further research involving acoustic analysis of final plosive voicing contrasts would provide further insights into the neurological substrates involved.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor operations, cognitive tasks and affective processes. Here, we revisit the concept of the cerebellar syndrome in the light of recent advances in our understanding of cerebellar operations. The key symptoms and signs of cerebellar dysfunction, often grouped under the generic term of ataxia, are discussed. Vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance are associated with lesions of the vestibulo-cerebellar, vestibulo-spinal, or cerebellar ocular motor systems. The cerebellum plays a major role in the online to long-term control of eye movements (control of calibration, reduction of eye instability, maintenance of ocular alignment). Ocular instability, nystagmus, saccadic intrusions, impaired smooth pursuit, impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and ocular misalignment are at the core of oculomotor cerebellar deficits. As a motor speech disorder, ataxic dysarthria is highly suggestive of cerebellar pathology. Regarding motor control of limbs, hypotonia, a- or dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetria, grasping deficits and various tremor phenomenologies are observed in cerebellar disorders to varying degrees. There is clear evidence that the cerebellum participates in force perception and proprioceptive sense during active movements. Gait is staggering with a wide base, and tandem gait is very often impaired in cerebellar disorders. In terms of cognitive and affective operations, impairments are found in executive functions, visual-spatial processing, linguistic function, and affective regulation (Schmahmann's syndrome). Nonmotor linguistic deficits including disruption of articulatory and graphomotor planning, language dynamics, verbal fluency, phonological, and semantic word retrieval, expressive and receptive syntax, and various aspects of reading and writing may be impaired after cerebellar damage. The cerebellum is organized into (a) a primary sensorimotor region in the anterior lobe and adjacent part of lobule VI, (b) a second sensorimotor region in lobule VIII, and (c) cognitive and limbic regions located in the posterior lobe (lobule VI, lobule VIIA which includes crus I and crus II, and lobule VIIB). The limbic cerebellum is mainly represented in the posterior vermis. The cortico-ponto-cerebellar and cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops establish close functional connections between the cerebellum and the supratentorial motor, paralimbic and association cortices, and cerebellar symptoms are associated with a disruption of these loops.},

A discriminant analysis was used to differentiate speech and non-speech parameters between groups. Regularity of DDK was specifically impaired in SCA3, whereas impairments of speech parameters, i.e., rate and modulation were stronger affected in SCA6.

An intelligibility test designed by Kent, Weismer, Kent, and Rosenbek (1989a) groups target and error words in minimal-pair contrasts. This format allows for construction of phonetic error profiles based on listener responses, thus allowing for a direct comparison of the acoustic characteristics of vowels perceived as the intended target with those heard as something other than the target. The high-low vowel contrast was found to be a consistent error across clinical groups and therefore was selected for acoustic analysis. The contrast was expected to have well-defined acoustic measures or correlates, derived from the literature, that directly relate to a listeners' responses for that token. These measures include the difference between the second and first formant frequency (F2-F1), the difference between F1 and the fundamental frequency (FO), and vowel duration. Results showed that the acoustic characteristics of tongue-height errors were not clearly differentiated from the acoustic characteristics of targets. Rather, the acoustic characteristics of errors often looked like noisy (nonprototypical) versions of the targets. Results are discussed in terms of the test from which the errors were derived and within the framework of speech perception theory.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the importance of fundamental frequency (F0) as a perceptual cue for identification of vowel targets produced by speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been suggested in the literature that F0 is a redundant cue for vowel identification in highly intelligible speech. For speakers with dysarthria who are having difficulty with segmental and suprasegmental aspects of production which result in ambiguous or conflicting cues in the acoustic signal, F0 may have increased perceptual importance for accurate identification of vowel targets. In the present study, F0 contours for single-word targets produced in sentence level material by 20 speakers with PD and 20 control speakers were synthetically modified in several different ways (i.e., flattened and enhanced). Listener identification of vowel targets across the F0 conditions was recorded. The accuracy of vowel identification for the control group was not affected by the flattening of the F0 contour. For the speakers with PD, however, modification of the F0 contour (flattening or enhancing) affected the accuracy with which listeners identified certain vowels. Differences in vowel identification were found primarily for the front vowels /I, epsilon, ae/ along a high-low continuum.},

The relevancy of nonspeech oral motor behaviors to speech motor performance in assessment and treatment is challenged on several grounds. First, contemporary motor theory suggests that movement control is task specific. In other words, it is tied to the unique goals, sources of information, and characteristics of varying motor acts. Documented differences in movement characteristics for speech production versus nonspeech oral motor tasks support this claim. Second, advantages of training nonspeech oral motor tasks versus training speech production are not supported by current principles of motor learning and neural plasticity. Empirical data supports experience-specific training. Finally, functional imaging studies document differences in activation patterns for speech compared with nonspeech oral motor tasks in neurologically healthy individuals.},

Using a large read corpus, we show that these four factors show different types of reduction effects, and that there are reduction effects of prosody independent of duration, and vice versa, suggesting the existence of multiple processes underlying reduction.},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the perception of prosodic prominence and the interpretation of focus position in the unrelated languages, Samoan and English. In many languages, prosodic prominence is a key marker of focus, so it is expected that prosodic prominence would affect judgments of focus position. However, it is shown that focus position, in turn, influences the perception of prosodic prominence according to language-specific expectations about the alignment between focus position and nuclear accent placement. Two sets of parallel perception experiments in Samoan and English are reported. In the first, participants judged the most prosodically prominent word in sentences which varied in syntactic construction (cleft/canonical) and intended stress position (subject/object). In both languages, participants were more likely to choose the intended stressed word if it was in the focus position. However, this effect was much larger in Samoan, which fits with its relatively lower functionality of prosodic prominence. In the second experiment, participants were asked to choose which question had been asked, consistent with subject or object focus. It was found that in both languages, participants weighted syntactic and prosodic cues to focus in line with expectations from their language. These findings have implications for how we conceive the role of prosodic prominence in speech processing across languages.},

I claim that METRICAL STRUCTURE plays a central role (Ladd 2008, Truckenbrodt 1995).Information structure (defined as in Steedman 1991 and Vallduvi \& Vilkuna 1998) places strong constraints on the PROBABILISTIC mapping of words onto metrical prosodie structure—that is, foci usually align with nuclear accents and theme/rheme units with prosodie phrases, and themes are less metrically prominent than rhemes. It is shown that focus position, scope, and pragmatic interpretation are then derived by manipulating EXPECTED PROMINENCE within metrical structure. Broadly, the more prominent a word than expected, the more likely a contrastive reading; the less prominent, the more likely a givenness reading. Both constructed and naturally occurring examples from the Switchboard corpus are used.},

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) substantially relieves motor symptoms in advanced-stage patients for whom medication produces disabling dyskinesias. This study investigated speech changes as a result of DBS settings chosen to maximize motor performance. The speech of 10 PD patients and 12 normal controls was analyzed for syllable rate and variability, syllable length patterning, vowel fraction, voice-onset time variability, and spirantization. These were normalized by the controls' standard deviation to represent distance from normal and combined into a composite measure. Results show that DBS settings relieving motor symptoms can improve speech, making it up to three standard deviations closer to normal. However, the clinically motivated settings evaluated here show greater capacity to impair, rather than improve, speech. A feedback device developed from these findings could be useful to clinicians adjusting DBS parameters, as a means for ensuring they do not unwittingly choose DBS settings which impair patients' communication.},

  abstract = {In this special collection entitled Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the World's Languages, we have compiled eleven studies investigating the voicing contrast in 19 languages. The collection provides extensive data obtained from 270 speakers across those languages, examining VOT and other acoustic, aerodynamic and articulatory measures. The languages studied may be divided into four groups: `aspirating' languages with a two-way contrast (English, three varieties of German); `true voicing' languages with a two-way contrast (Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, two Iranian languages Pashto and Wakhi); languages with a three-way contrast (Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Yerevan Armenia, three Indo-Aryan languages, Dawoodi, Punjabi and Shina, and Burushaki spoken in India); and Indo-Aryan languages with a more than three-way contrast (Jangli and Urdu with a four-way contrast, and Sindhi and Siraiki with a five-way contrast). We discuss the cross-linguistic data, focusing on how much VOT alone tells us about the voicing contrast in these languages, and what other phonetic dimensions (such as consonant-induced F0 and voice quality) are needed for a complete understanding of laryngeal contrast in these languages. Implications for various issues emerge: universal phonetic feature systems, effects of language contact on linguistic levelling, and the relation between laryngeal contrast and supralaryngeal articulation. The cross-linguistic VOT data also lead us to discuss how the distribution of VOT as measured acoustically may allow us to infer the underlying articulation and how it might be approached in gestural phonologies. The discussion on these multiple issues sparks new questions to be resolved, and provide indications of where the field may be best directed in exploring laryngeal contrast in voicing in the world's languages.},

  abstract = {The influence of information structure (IS: givenness, accessibility, newness and focus) on pitch accent assignment and acoustic prominence measures of prenuclear words was investigated for American English speech elicited through read production of mini-stories. Results showed a consistent pattern of accenting the initial content word in the sentence, supporting an analysis of prenuclear accent as structural, or ‘rhythmic’. While no association was observed between IS and accent type (e.g., H*, L*, L+H*, L*+H), the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence was modulated by information structure. In particular, words that carry contrastive focus generally showed more extreme f0 excursions relative to the average. In addition, there was a strong influence of speaking style or ‘affect’ on both pitch accent type and the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence. Speakers were more likely to produce L+H* accents in a lively than a neutral speaking style. Differences in affect were also strongly reflected in f0 excursion, duration, and amplitude within the target word. Overall, this study indicates both linguistic (information structure) and paralinguistic (affect) influences on the phonetic implementation of prenuclear prominence, with varying influence of these two factors on the phonological assignment of prenuclear pitch accents.},

  abstract = {Information structure is said to play an important role in determining phrasal prominence and the assignment of nuclear pitch accents in English. Early accounts claim that discourse-new or focused words receive a prominence-lending high/rising pitch accent, while given words are unaccented, with reduced prominence. Empirical findings are varied, but paint a more complex picture of the prosodic encoding of information structure. The present study investigated the phonological and phonetic encoding of information status and contrastive focus in nuclear position in American English, from speech read under neutral and lively affect. Given information was associated with decreased phonological and phonetic prominence, contrastive information with enhanced prominence, while new information corresponded to increased phonological, but not phonetic prominence, as assessed in pitch accent type, duration, intensity, and voice quality. The findings indicate a probabilistic relationship between information structure and nuclear pitch accent type, and gradient expression of information structure in acoustic prominence.},

Target consonants are analyzed from utterance (U) or Intonational Phrase (IP)-initial position, U/IP-final position, and U/IP-medial position, with and without contrastive focal accent. VOT and F0 at the onset of the following vowel are measured as the main acoustic correlates of voicing in English from the speech of six male American English speakers. The statistical results indicate that the accentual effect is greater and more consistent than the boundary effect on acoustic patterns. The distribution of acoustic measures also shows a greater distinction between the two contrastive stops when accented. Positional variation is not very distinctive, and the enhanced contrast marking in domain-initial position predicted from articulatory studies is not observed in the present setting.},

  abstract = {Substantial empirical research has revealed that temporal and spectral phonetic vowel reduction occurs in “easy” processing contexts relative to “hard” processing contexts, including effects of lexical frequency, lexical neighborhood density, semantic predictability, discourse mention, and speaking style. Theoretical accounts of this phonetic reduction process include listener-oriented approaches, in which the reduction reflects the talker’s balancing the comprehension needs of the listener with production effort constraints, talker-oriented approaches, in which reduction is argued to result entirely from constraints on speech production processes, and evolutionary approaches, in which reduction results directly from long-term interactive communication within a community. Recent research in our laboratory has revealed complex interactions among the linguistic, social, and cognitive factors involved in phonetic vowel reduction processes. These interactions reveal variation in the robustness of phonetic reduction effects across linguistic factors, as well as different patterns of interactions among linguistic, social, and cognitive factors across acoustic domains. These interactions challenge aspects of each of the three existing models of phonetic reduction. We therefore propose that a more complex view of the relationship between processing demands and phonetic vowel reduction processes is necessary to account for these observed patterns of variation.},

  abstract = {Much of what is known about prosody is based on native speaker intuitions of idealized speech, or on prosodic annotations from trained annotators whose auditory impressions are augmented by visual evidence from speech waveforms, spectrograms and pitch tracks. Expanding the prosodic data currently available to cover more languages, and to cover a broader range of unscripted speech styles, is prohibitive due to the time, money and human expertise needed for prosodic annotation. We describe an alternative approach to prosodic data collection, with coarse-grained annotations from a cohort of untrained annotators performing rapid prosody transcription (RPT) using LMEDS, an open-source software tool we developed to enable large-scale, crowd-sourced data collection with RPT. Results from three RPT experiments are reported. The reliability of RPT is analysed comparing kappa statistics for lab-based and crowd-sourced annotations for American English, comparing annotators from the same (US) versus different (Indian) dialect groups, and comparing each RPT annotator with a ToBI annotation. Results show better reliability for same-dialect annotators (US), and the best overall reliability from crowd-sourced US annotators, though lab-based annotations are the most similar to ToBI annotations. A generalized additive mixed model is used to test differences among annotator groups in the factors that predict prosodic annotation. Results show that a common set of acoustic and contextual factors predict prosodic labels for all annotator groups, with only small differences among the RPT groups, but with larger effects on prosodic marking for ToBI annotators. The findings suggest methods for optimizing the efficiency of RPT annotations. Overall, crowd-sourced prosodic annotation is shown to be efficient, and to rely on established cues to prosody, supporting its use for prosody research across languages, dialects, speaker populations, and speech genres.},

  abstract = {The perception of prosodic prominence in spontaneous speech is investigated through an online task of prosody transcription using untrained listeners. Prominence is indexed through a probabilistic prominence score assigned to each word based on the proportion of transcribers who perceived the word as prominent. Correlation and regression analyses between perceived prominence, acoustic measures and measures of a word’s information status are conducted to test three hypotheses: (i) prominence perception is signal-driven, influenced by acoustic factors reflecting speakers’ productions; (ii) perception is expectation-driven, influenced by the listener’s prior experience of word frequency and repetition; (iii) any observed influence of word frequency on perceived prominence is mediated through the acoustic signal. Results show correlates of perceived prominence in acoustic measures, in word log-frequency and in the repetition index of a word, consistent with both signal-driven and expectation-driven hypotheses of prominence perception. But the acoustic correlates of perceived prominence differ somewhat from the correlates of word frequency, suggesting an independent effect of frequency on prominence perception. A speech processing account is offered as a model of s­ignal-driven and expectation-driven effects on prominence perception, where prominence ratings are a function of the ease of lexical processing, as measured through the activation levels of lexical and sub-lexical units.},

Results indicated that despite reduced amplitudes of jaw and upper lip displacement in PD subjects, all three of these oral movements were of normal duration. Secondly, PD lower lip movements manifested no deficits and bradykinesia (reduced velocity) was only found in movements of the jaw. Finally, there was an indication of movement coordination aberrations in these parkinsonian subjects. Overall, these results not only suggest a difference between orofacial and limb movement impairments in PD, but also document the need to broaden our perspectives on this movement disorder by examining a wider range of functional motor tasks.},

The study included 8 speakers with ataxic dysarthria (AD), 16 speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) as a result of Parkinson's disease, and 24 unimpaired control participants. Each participant performed a series of sentence repetitions under habitual, fast, and slow speaking rate conditions. An algorithm to measure utterance-to-utterance spectro-temporal variation (UUV; Cummins, 2009) was used. Speech rate and intelligibility were also measured. UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the AD but not the HD groups, presumably because of differences in intelligibility in the samples used and not because of differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared with habitual and fast speaking rates. UUV results were consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way. The results suggest that the UUV could be developed into an easy-to-use clinical tool that could function as a valid and reliable assessment and outcome measure.},

Maximum force and contraction duration did not differ significantly between both conditions, but the integrated measurement of both (area under curve) was significantly larger in the on-state. The force decay slope was significantly lower in the on-state. No correlations were found with disease severity, disease stage or age. These findings fit the known pathophysiological effects on patterns of isometric muscle contraction in PD. It remains to be demonstrated if the effects of levodopa on tongue strength and endurance correlate with alterations in speech intelligibility, articulation and respiration.},

Twenty-five patients were studied before and after levodopa administration while reading a standardized text. In accordance with previous studies, no significant improvement of speech rate was found. Rather an increased variability of speech rate in the on-medication state could be demonstrated. It is possible that this increased variability may be the consequence of respiratory deficits due to levodopa-induced dyskinesia or an increase of dysfluencies.

To evaluate, in the ataxic dysarthria, the relationship between the vowel space area (VSA), the formant centralization ratio (FCR) and the mean of the primary distances with the speech intelligibility. A sample of fourteen Spanish speakers, ten with dysarthria and four controls, was used. The values of first and second formants in 140 vowels extracted of 140 words were analyzed. To calculate the level of intelligibility seven listeners were involved and a task of identification verbal stimuli was used. The dysarthric subjects have less contrast between middle and high vowels and between back vowels. Significant differences in the VSA, FCR and mean of the primary distances compared to control subjects (p = 0.007, 0.005 and 0.030, respectively) are observed. Regression analysis show the relationship between VSA and the mean of primary distances with the level of speech intelligibility (r = 0.60 and 0.74, respectively). Ataxic dysarthria subjects have lower contrast and vowel centralization in carrying out the vowels. The acoustic measures studied in this preliminary work have a high sensitivity in the detection of dysarthria but only the VSA and the mean of primary distances provide information on the severity of this type of speech disturbance.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) or posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) consists of a constellation of neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological and neurogenic speech and language deficits. It is most commonly observed in children after posterior fossa tumor surgery. The most prominent feature of CMS is mutism, which generally starts after a few days after the operation, has a limited duration and is typically followed by motor speech deficits. However, the core speech disorder subserving CMS is still unclear. This study investigates the speech and language symptoms following posterior fossa medulloblastoma surgery in a 12-year-old right-handed boy. An extensive battery of formal speech (DIAS = Diagnostic Instrument Apraxia of Speech) and language tests were administered during a follow-up of 6 weeks after surgery. Although the neurological and neuropsychological (affective, cognitive) symptoms of this patient are consistent with Schmahmann's syndrome, the speech and language symptoms were markedly different from what is typically described in the literature. In-depth analyses of speech production revealed features consistent with a diagnosis of apraxia of speech (AoS) while ataxic dysarthria was completely absent. In addition, language assessments showed genuine aphasic deficits as reflected by distorted language production and perception, wordfinding difficulties, grammatical disturbances and verbal fluency deficits. To the best of our knowledge this case might be the first example that clearly demonstrates that a higher level motor planning disorder (apraxia) may be the origin of disrupted speech in CMS. In addition, identification of non-motor linguistic disturbances during follow-up add to the view that the cerebellum not only plays a crucial role in the planning and execution of speech but also in linguistic processing. Whether the cerebellum has a direct or indirect role in motor speech planning needs to be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes (Beckman \& Edwards, 1990; Fougeron \& Keating, 1997). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F0 and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F0 space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who undergo subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) often develop a deterioration in speech performance, but there is no clear consensus on the specific effects seen or the mechanism involved and little description of the impact of DBS on conversational speech. Furthermore, there has been no fiber tract connectivity analysis to identify the structures potentially modulated by DBS to cause such deficits. The main objective of this study was to quantify spontaneous speech performance and identify potential involvement of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTt) in patients who underwent STN DBS, because this tract has been implicated in speech deterioration. METHODS Spontaneous speech samples were obtained with STN DBS in both on and off modes in 35 patients with PD and assessed across multiple domains. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography seeded from the therapeutic DBS contacts was performed to identify the fiber tracts involved and, specifically, the DRTt. The position of active electrode contacts was assessed relative to that of the STN. RESULTS Fifteen patients with akinetic-rigid (AR) PD and 20 with tremor-dominant (TD) PD subtypes were identified. In the AR-PD subgroup of patients, in whom there was DRTt involvement, 71\% demonstrated much better overall speech and largely improved or unchanged fluency in the DBS-off condition. In patients with TD PD with DRTt involvement, 50\% demonstrated better overall speech in the off condition, and equivocal results regarding improved or worsened fluency were found. When there was minimal DRTt involvement, 75\% of patients with AR PD had better overall speech in the DBS-on condition and better or minimal fluency changes. Similarly, 83\% of patients with TD PD with minimal DRTt involvement had better or minimal overall speech and fluency changes in the on condition. More medially placed left electrode contacts were associated with more DRTt involvement in 77\% of patients (10 of 13). CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to have investigated a specific fiber tract involved in STN DBS in different subtypes of PD relative to its impact on spontaneous speech. At optimal therapeutic programming of STN DBS, overall spontaneous speech and fluency were affected more negatively in patients with AR PD than in those with TD PD when there was DRTt involvement. After fiber tract analysis and modeling, it was found that medially positioned left electrode contacts more often involved fibers of the DRTt. If possible, avoidance of the DRTt by using active electrode contacts that are positioned less medially, specifically in patients with AR PD, might result in less speech deterioration.},

The book explores the changes in higher education nationally and internationally since the publication of the previous edition, includes additional procedures for integrating one's course, and adds strategies for dealing with student resistance to innovative teaching. This edition continues to provide conceptual and procedural tools that are invaluable for all teachers when designing instruction. It shows how to use a taxonomy of significant learning and systematically combine the best research-based practices for learning-centered teaching with a teaching strategy in a way that results in powerful learning experiences for students. Acquiring a deeper understanding of the design process will empower teachers to creatively design courses that will result in significant learning for students"--},

  abstract = {Research has found that speaking rate has an effect on voice onset time (VOT). Given that Parkinson disease (PD) affects speaking rate, the purpose of this study was to examine VOT with the effect of rate removed (VOT ratio), along with the traditional VOT measure, in individuals with PD. VOT and VOT ratio were examined in 9 individuals with PD (before and after taking medication), along with 9 matched controls. Place of articulation and vowel height had significant effects on VOT and VOT ratio for all groups, and there were no PD versus control differences. PD medication had a greater effect on VOT than VOT ratio, reflecting a rate-related VOT change rather than a pure VOT change. These data support the usefulness of examining both VOT and VOT ratio with individuals with PD, as this allows for dissociation between rate-related VOT changes and true VOT changes.},

  abstract = {Purpose The strength of the relationship between vowel centralization measures and perceptual ratings of dysarthria severity has varied considerably across reports. This article evaluates methods of acoustic-perceptual analysis to determine whether procedural changes can strengthen the association between these measures. Method Sixty-one speakers (17 healthy individuals and 44 speakers with dysarthria) read a standard passage. To obtain acoustic data, 2 points of formant extraction (midpoint and articulatory point) and 2 frequency measures (Hz and Bark) were trialed. Both vowel space area and an adapted formant centralization ratio were calculated using first and second formants of speakers' corner vowels. Twenty-eight listeners rated speech samples using different prompts: one with a focus on intelligibility, the other on speech precision. Results Perceptually, listener ratings of speech precision provided the best index of acoustic change. Acoustically, the combined use of an articulatory-based formant extraction point, Bark frequency units, and the formant centralization ratio was most effective in explaining perceptual ratings. This combination of procedures resulted in an increase of 17\% to 27\% explained variance between measures. Conclusions The procedures researchers use to assess articulatory impairment can significantly alter the strength of relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures. Procedures that maximize this relationship are recommended.},

  abstract = {Acoustic and kinematic analyses, as well as perceptual evaluation, were conducted on the speech of Parkinsonian and normal geriatric adults. As a group, the Parkinsonian speakers had very limited jaw movement compared to the normal geriatrics. For opening gestures, jaw displacements and velocities produced by the Parkinsonian subjects were about half those produced by the normal geriatrics. Lower lip movement amplitude and velocity also were reduced for the Parkinsonian speakers relative to the normal geriatrics, but the magnitude of the reduction was not as great as that seen in the jaw. Lower lip closing velocities expressed as a function of movement amplitude were greater for the Parkinsonian speakers than for the normal geriatrics. This increased velocity of lower lip movement may reflect a difference in the control of lip elevation for the Parkinsonian speakers, an effect that increased with the severity of dysarthria. Acoustically, the Parkinsonian subjects had reduced durations of vocalic segments, reduced formant transitions, and increased voice onset time compared to the normal geriatrics. These effects were greater for the more severe, compared to the milder, dysarthrics and were most apparent in the more complex, vocalic gestures.},

The finding is that talkers distinguish old words by shortening them. Two experiments show that old words are less intelligible than new words presented in isolation, but probably are not less identifiable in context. We infer that talkers may attenuate their productions of words when they can do so without sacrificing communicative efficacy. Old words can be reduced because they are repetitions of earlier presented items and because of the contextual support they receive. Two final experiments show that listeners can identify new and old words as such and that they can use information that a word is old more or less as they would use an anaphor to promote retrieval of the earlier production in its context.},

Speech materials from 10 individuals with PD and 10 gender- and age-matched neurologically healthy controls (HC) were recorded and analyzed. The four acoustic measures (peak intensity, peak F0, vowel duration, and acoustic vowel space area) of stressed and unstressed syllables were compared to determine which acoustic parameters are preferentially employed by each group to mark contrastive stress. The results indicated that individuals with PD exhibited significant changes in vowel duration and intensity of stressed/unstressed words to mark contrastive stress in similar ways to their HC counterparts. Unlike the HC group, individuals with PD did not demonstrate an expanded vowel space area (VSA) or employed changes in F0 to mark contrastive stress. Findings on which abilities are better preserved in the PD population for the purposes of marking contrastive stress add to our knowledge of prosodic deficits in this dysarthric population and can aid in the planning and executing of intervention services.},

  abstract = {Perceptual, acoustic and physiological (electromyographic and kinematic) studies addressing the features of the Parkinsonian speech are reviewed. Perceptual features are the following: 1) aprosody, i.e. monopitch, monoloudness, diminished stress contrasts and rate abnormalities, 2) impairment of articulation such as imprecise consonants, and 3) vocal quality deviation as harsh or breathy voice. The physical basis that is acoustic parameters corresponding to these perceptual impressions, such as fundamental frequency, intensity, duration, speech rate, have been analyzed. However, movement studies associated with electromyographic analysis in an important adjunct to more traditional investigations. The physiological studies are yet limited, they show that patients with Parkinson's disease have 1) reduced articulatory displacements relative to normal speakers, which may appear as rigidity, 2) improper coordination of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs or groups. Besides, some results show that pharmacological or surgical treatment improving akinesia, rigidity and tremor are not always successful in speech.},

  abstract = {We assessed the oral system of parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral chronic stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim), and of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to compare the effects of these procedures on the articulatory organs. Force transducers were used to sample ramp-and-hold force contractions generated by the upper lip, lower lip and tongue at 1- and 2-newton target force levels, as well as maximal force. Fourteen healthy control subjects and 14 parkinsonian patients participated in this study. After an overnight fast the patients were evaluated under two conditions: during bilateral stimulation and 1 h after stopping stimulation. With Vim stimulation, dynamic and static control of the articulatory organs was worsened while with STN stimulation it was greatly improved. The target of stimulation differently influences the oral system and modulates neuronal structures involved in speech.},

With STN stimulation, reaction and movement time of the articulatory organs decreased and their maximal strength, as well as their precision increased.

Method                                Sixteen typical speakers of American English were instructed to produce VOT utterances under four conditions: baseline, high pitch, effort, and strain. Repeated-measures analysis of variance models were used to analyze the effects of condition on VOT means and standard deviations (                 SD                 s); pairwise comparisons were used to determine significant differences between conditions.                                                        Results                                Voicing, condition, and their interaction significantly affected VOT means. Voiceless VOT means significantly decreased for high pitch (                 p                 {$<$} .001) relative to baseline; however, no changes in voiceless VOT means were found for effort or strain relative to baseline. Although condition had a significant effect on VOT                 SD                 s, there were no significant differences between effort, strain, and high pitch conditions relative to baseline.                                                        Conclusions               Speakers with typical voices likely engage different musculature to increase pitch than to increase vocal effort and strain. The increased VOT variability present with vocal hyperfunction is not seen in individuals with typical voices using increased effort and strain, supporting the assertion that this feature of vocal hyperfunction may be related to disordered vocal motor control rather than resulting from effortful voice production.},

Alternative Semantics provides an insightful account of what prosodic focus means, and gives us a notation that can help with better characterizing focus-related phenomena and the terminology used to describe them. We can also translate theoretical ideas about focus and givenness into this notation to facilitate a comparison between frameworks. The discussion will partly be structured by an evaluation of the theories of Givenness, the theory of Relative Givenness, and Unalternative Semantics, but we will cover a range of other ideas and proposals in the process. The chapter concludes with a discussion of phonological issues, and of association with focus.},

Polish patterns like En-glish in showing prosodic focus marking in a broad range of contexts, and differs in this regard from Romance languages, despite the fact that aspects of the prosodic system of Polish are more similar to Romance. Finally, the results do not support the claim in [7, 8] that word prominence is shifted from the penult syllable to the initial syllable under focus.}

Six speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease served as subjects. Paced temporal alterations were created by slowing each speaker to 60\% of his/her habitual speaking rate. The synthetic alterations were created by modifying the habitual rate speech samples using digital signal processing. Three types of synthetic alterations were examined: Pause Altered, Speech Duration Altered, and Pause and Speech Duration Altered. The 60\% of habitual speaking rate condition was more intelligible than the synthetic conditions. In addition, none of the synthetic alterations were found to be more intelligible than samples produced at habitual speaking rates. The results suggest that simple alterations of speech signals do not explain the differences in intelligibility that have been observed when parkinsonian dysarthric speakers reduce speaking rates. Reasons for the failure of synthetic alterations to increase speech intelligibility scores are discussed.},

Previous research indicated increases in both speech and pause time when the speaking rate of persons with Parkinson disease was reduced. This preliminary investigation sought to examine what occurs when speech time increases with decreases in speech rate. The data indicated that, despite similar levels of dysarthria and disease severity, there were different patterns of segmental duration change when speaking rate was reduced. Two of the three participants showed increases in duration toward that obtained from normal controls when rate was reduced. Not all changes in segmental duration were considered perceptually important. The need for additional acoustic measures and an examination of the interaction between consonant and vowel duration change is discussed},

It is thought to be measurable as equalized syllable durations. There are seemingly contradictory prosodic-temporal characteristics of ataxic dysarthria: perceptually characterised as prosodic excess as well as phonatory-prosodic insufficiency and acoustic characteristics including signs of isochrony as well as variability. This study investigates the temporal characteristics at two levels, duration and variability of syllable durations and the durations of interstress intervals. A group of 14 individuals with MS and ataxic dysarthria as well as 15 control subjects were studied. It was concluded that individuals with ataxic dysarthria and MS showed (a) for syllables: significantly increased durations and decreased intrautterance variability (more isochrony or syllable equalization) as well as significantly increased interutterance variability; (b) for interstress intervals: significantly increased durations and increased variability (less isochrony). The results point to inflexibility as well as instability of temporal control, which could contribute to the explanation of why the perceptual characteristics are contradictory.},

Researchers would like to compute effect size indexes based on the standardized mean difference to compare the results of cluster-randomized studies (and corresponding quasi-experiments) with other studies and to combine information across studies in meta-analyses. This article addresses the problem of defining effect sizes in multilevel designs and computing estimates of those effect sizes and their standard errors from information that is likely to be reported in journal articles. Three effect sizes are defined corresponding to different standardizations. Estimators of each effect size index are also presented along with their sampling distributions (including standard errors).},

The computed EGG spectrograms allowed us to differentiate various kinds of phonatory disturbances: intervals with subharmonic energy (“low-frequency segments”), “noise-like regions,” and abrupt shifts of fundamental frequency (F0). Female PD subjects presented with a significantly increased portion of subharmonic segments and with significantly more abrupt F0 shifts as compared to both controls and male PD subjects. Presumably, these alterations in spectral energy distribution reflect different oscillatory modes of the glottal source. Thus, PD seems to have a differential impact on phonation in men and women. Conceivably, these gender-specific vocal dysfunctions are determined by the well-known sexual dimorphism of laryngeal size.},

The test sentences comprised a systematically varied nonsense word embedded into a carrier phrase. Anticipatory and perseverative coarticulation were characterized by different patterns of durational and spectral features. Inter-speaker variability was considerable, particularly with respect to anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation. As a rule, slowing of speaking rate resulted in a decrease of perseverative coarticulation in the presence of unchanged anticipatory effects. In conclusion, these data corroborate the suggestion that different mechanisms underlie anticipatory and perseverative coarticulation.},

  abstract = {In order to analyze the impact of cerebellar disorders on temporal and spectral aspects of coarticulation, 9 individuals with cerebellar dysfunction and 9 controls were asked to produce test sentences comprising a target vowel (V = [a], [i], or [u]) within a schwa-t-V-t-schwa environment. The control speakers were investigated both at their habitual speech tempo and under a slow speaking condition. The squared distances between averaged FFT spectra served as a quantitative estimate of target-induced coarticulation, a method that can be applied to consonants as well as vowels, and which avoids the shortcomings of formant analysis. In order to test the significance of coarticulation effects at the level of individual speakers and to obtain F values as a further measure of the strength of coarticulation, multivariate tests of target effects were performed, with the first 6 principal components derived from the spectra of each speaker. First, inconsistent patterns of anticipatory vowel-to-vowel (W) interactions emerged across individuals, and neither significant group differences nor any effects of speech rate could be detected. The underlying control mechanisms thus seem to be segment-linked subject-specific specifications of the pretarget vowel, uncompromised by cerebellar dysfunction. Second, all participants exhibited highly significant anticipatory [t(h)]-to-vowel (CV) coarticulation. This effect was slightly smaller in the cerebellar group than in the control group, which can be at least partially explained by reduced spectral distances among the 3 target vowels. Speech rate did not influence the CV effects of the control group. As concerns temporal aspects of coarticulation, no significant group differences emerged in terms of length adjustments of the pretarget consonant to the intrinsic duration of the target vowel. Third, ataxic speakers showed a tendency toward enlarged perseverative vowel-to-[t(h)] (VC) and W effects if their slow speech rate was taken into account. Retentive coarticulation turned out to be similar in slow ataxic speakers and in fast-speaking controls. However, significant attenuation of these effects emerged in the latter group under the condition of decreased speech tempo. In summary, these results corroborate the suggestion of different mechanisms of gestural overlap in the temporal domain: Whereas perseverative coarticulation, presumably, reflects biomechanical or motor constraints, anticipation seems to represent higher level phonetic processing.},

Acoust. Soc. Am. 24, 175-184 (1952)]. The values for all control parameters remained constant throughout the 300-ms duration of each stimulus. A second set of 1520 signals was identical to these stimuli except that a falling pitch contour was used. The identification error rate for the flat-formant, flat-pitch signals was 27.3\%, several times greater than the 5.6\% error rate shown by Peterson and Barney's listeners. The introduction of a falling pitch contour resulted in a small but statistically reliable reduction in the error rate. The implications of these results for interpreting pattern recognition studies using the Peterson and Barney database are discussed. Results are also discussed in relation to the role of dynamic cues in vowel identification.},

Formant contours for F1-F4 were measured from LPC spectra using a custom interactive editing tool. For comparison with the PB data, formant patterns were sampled at a time that was judged by visual inspection to be maximally steady. Analysis of the formant data shows numerous differences between the present data and those of PB, both in terms of average frequencies of F1 and F2, and the degree of overlap among adjacent vowels. As with the original study, listening tests showed that the signals were nearly always identified as the vowel intended by the talker. Discriminant analysis showed that the vowels were more poorly separated than the PB data based on a static sample of the formant pattern. However, the vowels can be separated with a high degree of accuracy if duration and spectral change information is included.},

The data were specifically examined for range, velocity, and consistency (reproducibility) of the movements of the articulators, as well as the pattern of coordination of the different articulators involved. It was found in the case of ataxic dysarthria of cerebellar origin, for example, that the dynamic patterns were best represented as a difficulty in the initiation of purposeful movements and an inconsistency of articulatory movements, particularly in the repetitive production of a monosyllable. On EMG, breakdown of the rhythmical patterns in the articulatory muscles was quite obvious in the repetition of a monosyllable. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), decrease in the range and velocity of movements was noted. This resulted from reduced neuromuscular units (NMU) activities manifested in clinical EMG. Analysis of the dynamic aspects of the dysarthrias is a promising approach for elucidating the nature of central problems of speech production and for a differential diagnosis of various types of dysarthrias.},

A well-implanted lead in an appropriately selected patient is useless without the application of proper stimulation settings. DBS therapy introduces in many cases a delicate balance of electrical and pharma- cological treatment that requires a critical understanding of the principles of pulse generator programming. While the countless number of possible setting combinations seems to make programming a complicated and time-consuming endeavor, a systematic approach can prove invaluable in optimizing DBS therapy. This chapter outlines the general principles of stimulation, including the parameters that may be modulated to optimize therapy. We also review the common steps required to select optimal DBS contacts independent of the anatomical target and general troubleshooting guidelines. Programming issues relative to individual brain targets are addressed, which include the elements of anatomy, contact selection, medication adjustment (when appropriate), and specific stimulation-related side effects.},

Coder effects were assessed by measuring the intelligibility of vowels and consonants both before and after processing by the speech coders. Native English talkers who had normal hearing identified these speech sounds. Results confirmed that (a) all coders reduce the intelligibility of spoken language; (b) these effects occur in a consistent manner, with the GSM and CELP coders providing the least degradation relative to the original unprocessed speech; and (c) coders interact with individual voices so that speech is degraded differentially for different talkers.},

Speech quality was rated by 10 listeners with normal hearing on 28 different scales representing pitch and loudness changes, speech rate, laryngeal and resonatory dysfunction, and coder-induced distortions. Results showed that (a) nine scale items were consistently and reliably rated by the listeners; (b) all coders degraded speech quality on these nine scales, with the GSM and CELP coders providing the better quality speech; and (c) interactions between coders and individual voices did occur on several voice quality scales.},

  abstract = {Speakers naturally adopt a special “clear” (CLR) speaking style in order to be better understood by listeners who are moderately impaired in their ability to understand speech due to a hearing impairment, the presence of background noise, or both. In contrast, speech intended for nonimpaired listeners in quiet environments is referred to as “conversational” (CNV). Studies have shown that the intelligibility of CLR speech is usually higher than that of CNV speech in adverse circumstances. It is not known which individual acoustic features or combinations of features cause the higher intelligibility of CLR speech. The objective of this study is to determine the contribution of some acoustic features to intelligibility for a single speaker. The proposed method creates “hybrid” (HYB) speech stimuli that selectively combine acoustic features of one sentence spoken in the CNV and CLR styles. The intelligibility of these stimuli is then measured in perceptual tests, using 96 phonetically balanced sentences. Results for one speaker show significant sentence-level intelligibility improvements over CNV speech when replacing certain combinations of short-term spectra, phoneme identities, and phoneme durations of CNV speech with those from CLR speech, but no improvements for combinations involving fundamental frequency, energy, or nonspeech events (pauses).},

The measurement objective is complicated by the fact that intelligibility is not an absolute quantity but rather a relative quantity that depends on variables such as test material, personnel, training, test procedures, and state of the speaker. This paper reviews scaling procedures and item identification tests as they have been applied to dysarthric speech. Based in part on previous studies of speech of the hearing impaired, a profile has been designed to direct research on the acoustic or physiologic correlates of dysarthric intelligibility impairment. In addition, a word intelligibility test is proposed for use with dysarthric speakers. This test is designed to examine 19 acoustic-phonetic contrasts that are likely to (a) be sensitive to dysarthric impairment and (b) contribute significantly to speech intelligibility. Preliminary data from a sample of subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are presented to illustrate the use of this test in the phonetic interpretation of intelligibility impairment.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar disease affects a number of skilled movements, including those in speech. Ataxic dysarthria, the speech disorder that typically accompanies cerebellar disease, was studied by acoustic methods. Control subjects and subjects with ataxic dysarthria were recorded while performing a number of speaking tasks, including sustained vowel phonation, syllable repetition, monosyllabic word production (intelligibility test), sentence recitation, and conversation. Acoustic data derived from the speech samples confirmed the hypothesis that temporal dysregulation is a primary component of the speech disorder. The data also show that the nature of the disorder varies with the speaking task. This result agrees with observations on other motor systems in subjects with cerebellar disease and may be evidence of a dissociation of impairments. Suggestions are offered on the selection of measures for a given task and on the role of the cerebellum in the regulation of speaking.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach, Cepstral Separation Difference (CSD), for quantification of speech impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). CSD represents a ratio between the magnitudes of glottal (source) and supra-glottal (filter) log-spectrums acquired using the source-filter speech model. The CSD-based features were tested on a database consisting of 240 clinically rated running speech samples acquired from 60 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. The Guttmann (m2) monotonic correlations between the CSD features and the speech symptom severity ratings were strong (up to 0.78). This correlation increased with the increasing textual difficulty in different speech tests. CSD was compared with some nonCSD speech features (harmonic ratio, harmonic-to-noise ratio and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) for speech symptom characterization in terms of consistency and reproducibility. The high intra-class correlation coefficient (greater than 0.9) and analysis of variance indicates that CSD features can be used reliably to distinguish between severity levels of speech impairment. Results motivate the use of CSD in monitoring speech symptoms in PD.},

  abstract = {A problem in the clinical assessment of running speech in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to track underlying deficits in a number of speech components including respiration, phonation, articulation and prosody, each of which disturbs the speech intelligibility. A set of 13 features, including the cepstral separation difference and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were computed to represent deficits in each individual speech component. These features were then used in training a support vector machine (SVM) using n-fold cross validation. The dataset used for method development and evaluation consisted of 240 running speech samples recorded from 60 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. These speech samples were clinically rated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Examination of Speech (UPDRS-S). The classification accuracy of SVM was 85\% in 3 levels of UPDRS-S scale and 92\% in 2 levels with the average area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves of around 91\%. The strong classification ability of selected features and the SVM model supports suitability of this scheme to monitor speech symptoms in PD.},

Speakers read sentences and produced spontaneous speech. Acoustic measures of fundamental frequency, phrase-final syllable lengthening, intensity and speech rate were obtained. A group of listeners judged speech naturalness using a nine-point Likert scale. Relationships between judgements of speech naturalness and acoustic measures were determined for individual speakers with PD. Relationships among acoustic measures also were quantified. Despite variability between speakers, measures of mean F0, intensity range, articulation rate, average syllable duration, duration of final syllables, vocalic nucleus length of final unstressed syllables and pitch accent of final syllables emerged as possible acoustic variables contributing to within-speaker variations in speech naturalness. Results suggest that acoustic measures correlate with speech naturalness, but in dysarthric speech they depend on the speaker due to the within-speaker variation in speech impairment.},

  abstract = {Sentences spoken “clearly” (and slowly) are significantly more intelligible than those spoken “conversationally” for hearing-impaired listeners in a variety of backgrounds [Picheny, Durlach, and Braida, J. Speech Hear. Res. 28, 96-103 (1985); Uchanski et al., J. Speech Hear. Res. 39, 494-509 (1996); Payton, Uchanski, and Braida, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 1581-1592 (1994)]. However, it is unknown whether slower speaking rates are necessary for highly intelligible speech or whether an alternative form of clear speech exists at faster (i.e., normal) rates. To investigate this question, talkers with significant public speaking experience were asked to produce clear and conversational speech at slow, normal, and quick rates. A method for eliciting clear speech was introduced that ensured the clearest possible speech was obtained at each of these speaking rates. To probe for other highly intelligible speaking modes, talkers also recorded sentences in two other speaking modes: soft and loud. Intelligibility tests indicated that clear speech was the only speaking mode that provided a consistent intelligibility advantage over conversational speech. Moreover, the advantage of clear speech was extended to faster speaking rates than previously reported. These results suggest that clear speech has some inherent acoustic properties that contribute to its high intelligibility without altering rate. Identifying these acoustic properties could lead to improved signal-processing schemes for hearing aids.},

  abstract = {In adverse listening conditions, talkers can increase their intelligibility by speaking clearly [Picheny, M.A., et al. (1985). J. Speech Hear. Res. 28, 96-103; Payton, K. L., et al. (1994). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 1581-1592]. This modified speaking style, known as clear speech, is typically spoken more slowly than conversational speech [Picheny, M. A., et al. (1986). J. Speech Hear. Res. 29, 434-446; Uchanski, R. M., et al. (1996). J. Speech Hear. Res. 39, 494-509]. However, talkers can produce clear speech at normal rates (clear/normal speech) with training [Krause, J. C., and Braida, L. D. (2002). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 112, 2165-2172] suggesting that clear speech has some inherent acoustic properties, independent of rate, that contribute to its improved intelligibility. Identifying these acoustic properties could lead to improved signal processing schemes for hearing aids. Two global-level properties of clear/normal speech that appear likely to be associated with improved intelligibility are increased energy in the 1000-3000-Hz range of long-term spectra and increased modulation depth of low-frequency modulations of the intensity envelope [Krause, J. C., and Braida, L. D. (2004). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115, 362-378]. In an attempt to isolate the contributions of these two properties to intelligibility, signal processing transformations were developed to manipulate each of these aspects of conversational speech independently. Results of intelligibility testing with hearing-impaired listeners and normal-hearing listeners in noise suggest that (1) increasing energy between 1000 and 3000 Hz does not fully account for the intelligibility benefit of clear/normal speech, and (2) simple filtering of the intensity envelope is generally detrimental to intelligibility. While other manipulations of the intensity envelope are required to determine conclusively the role of this factor in intelligibility, it is also likely that additional properties important for highly intelligible speech at normal speech at normal rates remain to be identified.},

Judgments of intelligibility for sentences produced at a habitual rate (Habitual condition) and at a faster-than-habitual rate (Fast condition) by 46 speakers with PD or MS as well as a group of 32 healthy speakers revealed that the Fast condition was, on average, associated with decreased intelligibility. However, some speakers' intelligibility did not decline. To further understand the acoustic characteristics of varied intelligibility in the Fast condition for speakers with dysarthria, a subgroup of speakers with PD or MS whose intelligibility did not decline in the Fast condition (no decline group, n=8) and a subgroup of speakers with significantly declined intelligibility (decline group, n=8) were compared. Acoustic measures of global speech timing, suprasegmental characteristics, and utterance-level segmental characteristics for vocalics were examined for the two subgroups. Results suggest acoustic contributions to intelligibility under rate modulation are complex. Potential clinical relevance and implications for the acoustic bases of intelligibility are discussed.},

  abstract = {Acoustic variation in a passage read by speakers with dysarthria and healthy speakers was examined. 15 speakers with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 12 speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 14 healthy speakers were studied. Acoustic variables included measures of global speech timing (e.g., articulation rate, pause characteristics), vocal intensity (e.g., mean sound pressure level and intensity modulation), and segmental articulation (i.e., utterance-level second formant interquartile range (F2 IQR)). Acoustic measures were obtained from three segments operationally defined to represent the beginning, middle, and end of a reading passage. Two speaking conditions associated with common treatment techniques for dysarthria were included for comparison to a habitual speaking condition. These conditions included a slower-than-habitual rate (Slow) and greater-than-habitual intensity (Loud). There was some degree of acoustic variation across the three operationally-defined segments of the reading passage. The Slow, Loud and Habitual conditions yielded comparable characteristics of variation. Patterns of acoustic variation across the three passage segments also were largely similar across speaker groups. Within-task acoustic variation during passage reading should be considered when making decisions regarding speech sampling in clinical practice and research. The contributions of speech disorder severity and linguistic variables to within-task acoustic change warrant further investigation. Readers will be able to (1) discuss the motivation for studying and understanding within-task variation in contextual speech, (2) describe patterns of acoustic variation for speakers with dysarthria and healthy speakers during passage reading, (3) discuss the relationship between non-habitual speaking conditions and within-task variation, (4) understand the need to consider within-speaker, within-task variation in speech sampling.},

Professor Lambrecht explores the relationship between the structure of the sentence and the linguistic and extra-linguistic context in which it is used. His analysis is based on the observation that the structure of a sentence reflects a speaker's assumption about the hearer's state of knowledge and consciousness at the time of the utterance. This relationship between speaker assumptions and formal sentence structure is governed by rules and conventions of grammar, in a component called 'information structure'. Four independent but interrelated categories are analysed: presupposition and assertion, identifiability and activation, topic, and focus.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this preliminary experiment was to evaluate the effect of a flattened fundamental frequency (F0) contour on sentence intelligibility. The perceptual dimension monotone pitch is frequently used to describe the speech of persons with dysarthria, and relatively flat F0 contours have been noted in several acoustic studies of dysarthria. To determine the independent effect of a flattened F0 contour on sentence intelligibility a resynthesis technique was used that held timing and spectral characteristics of utterances constant while allowing parametric control over successive pitch periods. Two male speakers produced low-probability utterances selected from the SPIN test, which were then resynthesized with a flattened F0 contour. Speech intelligibility was assessed using two measures: one involving word transcription and the other interval scaling. These measures were collected from 10 listeners. The results showed that both measures were significantly lower when the F0 contour was flattened, as compared with naturally varying contours. Several different explanations are proposed for this effect, which can and should be explored in greater detail using the resynthesis technique given the prominence of this characteristic in dysarthria.},

Acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel spaces were examined at the same time sampling point using electromagnetic articulography in 11 speakers with dysarthria secondary to ALS and 11 speakers without dysarthria. Tongue kinematic data were collected from the tongue body sensor (\textasciitilde{} 25 mm posterior from the tongue apex). A number of acoustic and tongue body kinematic variables were tested. The result showed that the acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel dispersion patterns are different between the groups. Acoustic and tongue body kinematic vowel spaces are highly correlated; however, unlike acoustic vowel space, tongue body kinematic vowel space was not significantly different between the groups. Both acoustic and tongue kinematic vowel dispersion patterns are sensitive to the group difference, especially with high vowels. The tongue kinematic vowel space approach is too crude to differentiate the speakers with dysarthria secondary to ALS from speakers without dysarthria. To examine tongue range of motion in speakers with dysarthria, a more refined articulatory kinematic approach needs to be examined in the future.}

A multidimensional voice analysis computer program (IVANS, Avaaz Innovations, 1998) was employed to evaluate measures of traditional frequency and amplitude perturbation as well as time-based and linear prediction (LP) modeled “noise” parameters of the acoustic output in conjunction with perceptual judgments of overall vocal quality. The results indicate vocal deterioration of vocal function immediately following radiotherapy with gradual and significant improvement in acoustic and perceptual features over 9 to 12 months following the radiation treatment. Measures of glottal noise demonstrated higher sensitivity than frequency-based measures of voice perturbation, and with more consistent, less variable changes in acoustical voice output from the preradiation to the 12 month postradiation periods. Future research evaluating vowel type and acoustic perturbation measures with a larger sample of subjects over a longer time period seems warranted.},

In particular, in formation-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may inc lude maximizing the uni- formity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic r eduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control vari- ables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.},

Syntax comprehension and cognitive tests were administered to these subjects in the same test sessions. VOT disruptions for stop consonants in syllable initial position, similar to those noted for Broca's aphasia, occurred for nine subjects. Longer response times and errors in the comprehension of syntax as measured by the Rhode Island Test of Sentence Comprehension (RITLS) also occurred for these subjects. Anovas indicate that the VOT overlap subjects had significantly higher syntax error rates and longer response times on the RITLS than the VOT nonoverlap subjects–F(1, 70) = 12.38, p less than 0.0008; F(1, 70) = 7.70, p less than 0.007, respectively. The correlation between the number of VOT timing errors and the number of syntax errors was significant. (r = 0.6473, p less than 0.01). VOT overlap subjects also had significantly higher error rates in cognitive tasks involving abstraction and the ability to maintain a mental set. Prefrontal cortex, acting through subcortical basal ganglia pathways, is a component of the neural substrate that regulates human speech production, syntactic ability, and certain aspects of cognition. The deterioration of these subcortical pathways may explain similar phenomena in Broca's aphasia. Results are discussed in relation to “modular” theories.},

  abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to study relative contributions of speaking rate, temporal envelope, and temporal fine structure to clear speech perception. Experiment I used uniform time scaling to match the speaking rate between clear and conversational speech. Experiment II decreased the speaking rate in conversational speech without processing artifacts by increasing silent gaps between phonetic segments. Experiment III created “auditory chimeras” by mixing the temporal envelope of clear speech with the fine structure of conversational speech, and vice versa. Speech intelligibility in normal-hearing listeners was measured over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios to derive speech reception thresholds (SRT). The results showed that processing artifacts in uniform time scaling, particularly time compression, reduced speech intelligibility. Inserting gaps in conversational speech improved the SRT by 1.3 dB, but this improvement might be a result of increased short-term signal-to-noise ratios during level normalization. Data from auditory chimeras indicated that the temporal envelope cue contributed more to the clear speech advantage at high signal-to-noise ratios, whereas the temporal fine structure cue contributed more at low signal-to-noise ratios. Taken together, these results suggest that acoustic cues for the clear speech advantage are multiple and distributed.},

Specific phonemes that were misarticulated were catalogued. Other vocal-tract dysfunctions, including laryngeal disorders, rate disorders, and hypernasality, were also recorded. Cooccurrence of symptoms in each patient was tabulated. Examination of the patterns of cooccurring dysfunctions permitted classifying the 200 patients into five groups: Group 1 (45\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction as their only vocal-tract symptom; Group 2 (13.5\% of the patients) with laryngeal and back-tongue involvement; Group 3 (17\% of the patients) with laryngeal, back-tongue, and tongue-blade dysfunction; Group 4 (5.5\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction, back-tongue involvement, tongue-blade dysfunction, and labial misarticulations; and Group 5 (9\% of the patients) with laryngeal dysfunction and misarticulations of the back tongue, tongue blade, lips, and tongue tip. Disfluencies and hypernasality did not follow a systematic pattern of cooccurrence with other vocal-tract dysfunctions.},

  abstract = {Health-related quality of life is a patient-reported outcome that complements clinical evaluation and provides information about disease activity and effects of the treatment. The objective of this review is to present the conceptual framework, the measures, and some of their most relevant applications in the field of Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. Health-related quality of life is a subjective, individual, and multidimensional construct, and its main dimensions are physical, mental, and social, besides global perceptions of health and personal domains. Health-related quality of life measurement is carried out by means of questionnaires or scales, ideally self-applied by patients, and has a diversity of important applications for clinical practice, research, and health policy. Movement disorders and Parkinson's disease are complex conditions impacting all components of patients' health-related quality of life. The use of health-related quality of life tools provides important information on a variety of aspects that are important to patients while complementing clinical evaluations. In particular, studies using this kind of assessment can identify and monitor the most important health-related quality of life determinant factors, allowing tailored assistance and prioritized interventions. In addition, maintaining or improving the patients' health-related quality of life is an objective of care for chronic diseases and, therefore, it has to be monitored over time and as an outcome of clinical trials. Several methods are available for the interpretation of the change in scores of health-related quality of life measures, although a definitive agreement on the most appropriate method is yet to be determined. Presently, health-related quality of life assessment is an important outcome for research and management of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that consonant imprecision in Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from a reduction in amplitude of lingual movements or articulatory undershoot. While this has been postulated, direct measurement of the tongue's contact with the hard palate during speech production has not been undertaken. Therefore, the present study aimed to use electropalatography (EPG) to determine the exact nature of tongue-palate contact in a group of individuals with PD and consonant imprecision (n = 9). Furthermore, the current investigation also aimed to compare the results of the participants with PD to a group of aged (n = 7) and young (n = 8) control speakers to determine the relative contribution of ageing of the lingual musculature to any articulatory deficits noted. Participants were required to read aloud the phrase 'I saw a \_ today' with the artificial palate in-situ. Target words included the consonants /l/, /s/ and /t/ in initial position in both the /i/ and /a/ vowel environments. Phonetic transcription of phoneme productions and description of error types was completed. Furthermore, representative frames of contact were employed to describe the features of tongue-palate contact and to calculate spatial palatal indices. Results of the perceptual investigation revealed that perceived undershooting of articulatory targets distinguished the participant group with PD from the control groups. However, objective EPG assessment indicated that undershooting of the target consonant was not the cause of the perceived articulatory errors. It is, therefore, possible that reduced pressure of tongue contact with the hard palate, sub-lingual deficits or impaired articulatory timing resulted in the perceived undershooting of the target consonants.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations employing electropalatography (EPG) have identified articulatory timing deficits in individuals with acquired dysarthria. However, this technology is yet to be applied to the articulatory timing disturbance present in Parkinson's disease (PD). As a result, the current investigation aimed to use EPG to comprehensively examine the temporal aspects of articulation in a group of nine individuals with PD at sentence, word and segment level. This investigation followed on from a prior study (McAuliffe, Ward and Murdoch) and similarly, aimed to compare the results of the participants with PD to a group of aged (n = 7) and young controls (n = 8) to determine if ageing contributed to any articulatory timing deficits observed. Participants were required to read aloud the phrase “I saw a \_ today” with the EPG palate in-situ. Target words included the consonants /l/, /s/ and /t/ in initial position in both the /i/ and /a/ vowel environments. Perceptual investigation of speech rate was conducted in addition to objective measurement of sentence, word and segment duration. Segment durations included the total segment length and duration of the approach, closure/constriction and release phases of EPG consonant production. Results of the present study revealed impaired speech rate, perceptually, in the group with PD. However, this was not confirmed objectively. Electropalatographic investigation of segment durations indicated that, in general, the group with PD demonstrated segment durations consistent with the control groups. Only one significant difference was noted, with the group with PD exhibiting significantly increased duration of the release phase for /la/ when compared to both the control groups. It is, therefore, possible that EPG failed to detect lingual movement impairment as it does not measure the complete tongue movement towards and away from the hard palate. Furthermore, the contribution of individual variation to the present findings should not be overlooked.},

  abstract = {This study sought to characterize the relationship among voluntary rate modification, vocal tract acoustic output, and perceptual impressions of speech for individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). Healthy control speakers were studied for comparison purposes. Four research questions were addressed: (1) How is rate modification evidenced in acoustic measures of segmental and global timing? (2) What is the impact of rate modification on measures of acoustic working space for select vowels and consonants? (3) What is the impact of rate modification on perceptual impressions of severity? (4) Are rate-induced changes in measures of acoustic working space related to perceptual impressions of severity? Speakers read the Farm Passage at habitual, slow, and fast rates. The vowels /i/, /ae/, /u/, and /A/ and the fricatives /s/ and /S/ were of interest. Acoustic measures included articulatory rate, segment durations, vowel formant frequencies, and first moment coefficients. Measures of acoustic working space for vowels and fricatives also were derived. The results indicated that temporal acoustic measures changed in the expected direction across rate conditions, with a tendency toward slightly faster rates for the PD group. In addition, the relative rate change for the Fast and Slow conditions compared to the Habitual condition was similar across groups. Rate did not strongly affect measures of acoustic working space for the PD group as a whole, but there was a tendency for slower rates to be associated with larger measures of acoustic working space. Finally, there was not a strong relationship between perceived severity and measures of acoustic working space across the rate continuum for either group. Rather, the relationship between perceived severity and measures of acoustic working space was such that the PD group exhibited smaller measures of acoustic working space and more severe perceptual estimates than the control speakers, irrespective of rate condition.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have documented that speech with flattened or inverted fundamental frequency (F0) contours is less intelligible than speech with natural variations in F0. The purpose of this present study was to further investigate how F0 manipulations affect speech intelligibility in background noise. Speech recognition in noise was measured for sentences having the following F0 contours: unmodified, flattened at the median, natural but exaggerated, inverted, and sinusoidally frequency modulated at rates of 2.5 and 5.0 Hz, rates shown to make vowels more perceptually salient in background noise. Five talkers produced 180 stimulus sentences, with 30 unique sentences per F0 contour condition. Flattening or exaggerating the F0 contour reduced key word recognition performance by 13\% relative to the naturally produced speech. Inverting or sinusoidally frequency modulating the F0 contour reduced performance by 23\% relative to typically produced speech. These results support the notion that linguistically incorrect or misleading cues have a greater deleterious effect on speech understanding than linguistically neutral cues.},

Best clinical practice and pursuance of the evidence base for interventions would suggest measurement of intelligibility forms a vital role in clinical decision-making and monitoring. However, what should be measured to gauge intelligibility and how this is achieved and relates to clinical planning continues to be a topic of debate. This review considers the strengths and weaknesses of selected clinical approaches to intelligibility assessment, stressing the importance of explanatory, diagnostic testing as both a more sensitive and a clinically informative method. The worth of this, and any approach, is predicated, though, on awareness and control of key design, elicitation, transcription and listening/listener variables to maximize validity and reliability of assessments. These are discussed. A distinction is drawn between signal-dependent and -independent factors in intelligibility evaluation. Discussion broaches how these different perspectives might be reconciled to deliver comprehensive insights into intelligibility levels and their clinical/educational significance. The paper ends with a call for wider implementation of best practice around intelligibility assessment.},

  abstract = {Purpose       Interventions for speech disorders aim to produce changes that are not only acoustically          measurable or perceptible to trained professionals but are also apparent to naive          listeners. Due to challenges associated with obtaining ratings from suitably large          listener samples, however, few studies currently evaluate speech interventions by          this criterion. Online crowdsourcing technologies could enhance the measurement of          intervention effects by making it easier to obtain real-world listeners' ratings.              Method       Stimuli, drawn from a published study by Sapir et al. (“Effects of intensive voice          treatment (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment [LSVT]) on vowel articulation in dysarthric          individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease: Acoustic and perceptual findings” in          Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 50(4), 2007), were words produced by individuals who received intensive treatment (LSVT          LOUD) for hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to Parkinson's disease. Thirty-six online          naive listeners heard randomly ordered pairs of words elicited pre- and posttreatment          and reported which they perceived as “more clearly articulated.”              Results       Mixed-effects logistic regression indicated that words elicited posttreatment were          significantly more likely to be rated “more clear.” Across individuals, acoustically          measured magnitude of change was significantly correlated with pre–post difference          in listener ratings.              Conclusions       These results partly replicate the findings of Sapir et al. (2007) and demonstrate          that their acoustically measured changes are detectable by everyday listeners. This          supports the viability of using crowdsourcing to obtain more functionally relevant          measures of change in clinical speech samples.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of levodopa on isolated vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease, excluding speech fluctuations caused by dyskinesia. 21 patients (14 males and 7 females) and 21 age- and sex- matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Together with motor assessment, the patients phonated five Japanese isolated vowels (/a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/) 20 times before and 1 h after levodopa treatment. We made the frequency analysis of each vowel and measured the first and second formants. From these formants we constructed the pentagonal vowel space area which should be the good indicator for articulatory dysfunction of vowels. In control subjects, only speech samples were analyzed. To investigate the sequential relationship between plasma levodopa concentrations, motor performances, and acoustic measurements after treatment, entire drug cycle tests were performed in 4 patients. The pentagonal vowel space area was significantly expanded together with motor amelioration after levodopa treatment, although the enlargement is not enough for the space area of control subjects. Drug cycle tests revealed that sequential increases or decreases in plasma levodopa levels after treatment correlated well with expansion or decrease of the vowel space areas and improvement or deterioration of motor manifestations. Levodopa expanded the vowel space area and ameliorated motor performance, suggesting that dysfunctions in vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease are based on dopaminergic pathology.},

  abstract = {Purpose               We present a tripartite view of intelligibility in which the contributions of both the speaker and listener, as well as their joint effort during interaction, are considered. While considerable research has examined communicative interactions in situ, there is a critical gap in current knowledge on how speech intelligibility unfolds during such interactions. Here, we argue that research examining speech intelligibility in communicative interactions may provide important groundwork for advancement in clinical interventions for individuals with dysarthria.                                         Method               First, we describe the view and argue for its consideration as a powerful way of thinking about speech intelligibility. We then briefly situate the view in the relevant literature on speech intelligibility and existing theoretical frameworks. We then identify suitable methodological paradigms for studying joint contributions to intelligibility and, lastly, discuss the clinical application and potential impact of this tripartite view.                                         Conclusions               Speech communication occurs through interaction; however, in the laboratory and clinic, emphasis is usually placed on individual speakers and listeners. We have proposed that it is critical to consider how the joint contributions of speakers and listeners affect speech intelligibility in communicative interaction. This conceptualization is well aligned with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and the findings from such an approach will allow us to better understand how to maximize available resources to enhance speech intelligibility.                        ,},

  abstract = {When auditory feedback is perturbed in a consistent way, speakers learn to adjust their speech to compensate, a process known as sensorimotor adaptation. Although this paradigm has been highly informative for our understanding of the role of sensory feedback in speech motor control, its ability to induce behaviorally relevant changes in speech that affect communication effectiveness remains unclear. Because reduced vowel contrast contributes to intelligibility deficits in many neurogenic speech disorders, we examine human speakers’ ability to adapt to a nonuniform perturbation field that was designed to affect vowel distinctiveness, applying a shift that depended on the vowel being produced. Twenty-five participants were exposed to this “vowel centralization” feedback perturbation in which the first two formant frequencies were shifted toward the center of each participant’s vowel space, making vowels less distinct from one another. Speakers adapted to this nonuniform shift, learning to produce corner vowels with increased vowel space area and vowel contrast to partially overcome the perceived centralization. The increase in vowel contrast occurred without a concomitant increase in duration and persisted after the feedback shift was removed, including after a 10-min silent period. These findings establish the validity of a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to increase vowel contrast, showing that complex, nonuniform alterations to sensory feedback can successfully drive changes relevant to intelligible communication.},

Four standardized coders, viz.

Objective speech quality measures, including the auditory distance parameter based on the measuring normalizing blocks technique, and the perceptual speech quality measure, and subjective impressions of speech coder performance were used to assess the interaction between speech coder and speech disorder. Objective speech quality measures revealed that the performance of the LD-CELP and GSM RPE-LTP coders was not measurably influenced by the type of input speech, and that MELP, FS1015 LPC and to a certain extent FS1016 CELP exhibited degraded performance with speech samples from disordered talkers. Results from perceptual experiments were in contrast with the objective measures of speech quality; ratings of speech coder performance indicated that the listeners are less sensitive to coder-induced distortions with abnormal speech samples.},

The moment of release for stop consonants, called the burst, has been previously studied in individuals with PD and in other disorders. Multiple bursts (MBs) on the same stop consonant have been reported previously in some motor speech disorders, but no studies are known to have examined MBs in individuals with PD. The current study looked at the occurrences of bursts and MBs in initial stop consonants produced by nine individuals with PD (ON and OFF medication) and nine control speakers. Individuals with PD produced fewer overall bursts compared to control participants. In terms of place of articulation, individuals with PD primarily had loss of bursts in bilabial stops. In addition, individuals with PD had more MBs than control speakers, primarily in alveolars. Finally, no dopamine-related medication effects were found for occurrences of bursts or MBs in individuals with PD. Overall, the study provided evidence for loss of bursts and presence of MBs for stop consonants produced by individuals with PD.},

  abstract = {Exaggerated and redundant prosodic cue use has been noted among adults with dysarthria secondary to cerebral palsy (CP) (; ). A possible explanation may be that speakers heighten prosodic contrasts to increase intelligibility. The current work examined whether children with dysarthria due to CP also produce exaggerated prosodic contours and if so, how prosodic cue use in these speakers impacts intelligibility. Acoustic analyses were conducted on a previously collected dataset of 2-7 word utterances produced by fourteen children with CP (7 with dysarthria and 7 without) (). The dataset also included sentence-level transcriptions obtained from five listeners per speaker. Word intelligibility scores were derived from these transcripts and used to determine whether prosodic modulation differed for words with high versus low intelligibility. Although mean fundamental frequency (F0) and intensity range were similar across groups, words produced by children with dysarthria were slower and more variable in F0 than the group without dysarthria. Moreover, intelligibility decreased when children with dysarthria increased F0 and duration beyond the range used by children without dysarthria. Thus findings suggest that interventions targeting appropriate prosody may be beneficial in improving intelligibility in children with dysarthria and CP.},

Selection was based on a definite diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and adequate intelligence, hearing, and ability to perform the required tasks. Two estimates of speech intelligibility were obtained from naive listeners: single words correctly recognized and prose intelligibility rating. Diadochokinetic (DDK) syllable rates and percent correct articulation of selected phonemes were employed as indices of articulatory impairment. The 50 subjects were, on average, judged to be 50\% intelligible on both intelligibility estimates. Group mean DDK rate was 2.9 syllables per second and 78\% of phonemes were transcribed as correctly articulated. :The mean scores of the spastic subjects were superior to the athetoids on all speech measures, significantly so for single-word intelligibility and DDK rate even when group inequalities for physical disability and I.Q. were adjusted. In this sample, spastics were less physically disabled and had lower I.Q.'s than athetoids. Specific phonemic features characteristic of the dysarthria in cerebral-palsied subjects were: (1) anterior lingual place inaccuracy; (2) reduced precision of fricative and affricate manners; and (3) inability to achieve the extreme positions in the vowel articulatory space. A comparison of these results with those reported for children with cerebral palsy suggests that the consonantal place and manner problems are fairly stable features of cerebral palsy dysarthria.},

The subjects had a diagnosis of congenital cerebral palsy, and adequate intelligence, hearing, and ability to perform the speech task. Phonetic transcriptions were made of single-word utterances which contained 49 selected phonemes: 22 word-initial consonants, 18 word-final consonants and nine vowels. Errors of substitution, omission and distortion were categorized on confusion matrices such that patterns could be observed. It was found that within-manner errors (place or voicing errors or both) exceeded between-manner errors by a substantial amount, more so on final consonants. The predominant within-manner errors occurred on fricative phonemes for both initial and final positions. Affricate within-manner errors, all of devoicing, were also frequent in final position. The predominant between-manner initial position errors involved liquid-to-glide and affricate-to-stop changes, and for final position, affricate-to-fricative. Phoneme omission occurred three times more frequently on final than on initial consonants. The error data of individual subjects were found to correspond with the identified overall group patterns. Those with markedly reduced speech intelligibility demonstrated the same patterns of error as the overall group. The implications for treatment are discussed.},

Six animals were trained to maintain a static force for a 2-sec period, and two animals were trained to make a rapid series of bites on a force transducer four times in succession. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were chronically implanted into temporalis and masseter muscles. Lesions were made in the cerebellum in seven monkeys and a control surgery with no neural damage was performed on one monkey. Following cerebellar lesions, the abilities of the monkeys to maintain a static isometric force for 2 sec were impaired. Animals overshot the correct force band and force tremors increased in amplitude following the lesions. Cerebellar lesions were followed also by a reduction in biting frequency from about 3 Hz to 2 Hz. Measurements of the temporalis EMG indicated that the reduced biting rate was associated primarily with a prolongation of the inter-EMG interval and secondarily with a prolongation of the EMG duration. Changes in jaw-force regulation following the lesions appear to be similar to the types of changes observed in arm control in monkeys, and in the speech of persons with ataxic dysarthria.},

We analyzed the CTG repeat region of the SCA8 gene in a series of Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia. We also investigated the frequency of the CTG repeat length in Japanese normal elderly subjects older than age 79. Morphometric measurements on the cerebral MRI were compared between patients with SCA8 and SCA6. The number of the combined CTA/CTG repeats of six affected SCA8 alleles was 106.3+/-24.4 (mean +/- SD) ranging from 89 to 155 and that of normal elderly subjects was 24.3+/-4.4 (n = 104 alleles) ranging from 15 to 34. The mean age at onset of the SCA8 cases was 53.8+/-19.7 years, with a range from 20 to 73 years. One father and daughter from an SCA8 family showed remarkable paternal anticipation. The number increase from father to daughter was + 16 CTG repeats, with a 31-year acceleration of onset. The six identified SCA8 patients were clinically characterized by high frequencies of incoordination of trunk and limbs, ataxic dysarthria, impaired smooth pursuit, and horizontal nystagmus, and the MRI showed significant atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres compared with that of normal controls. There was no significant difference between SCA8 and SCA6 on the morphometric MRI study. The CTG repeat expansions in the SCA8 alleles were much greater than the range of repeats in normal elderly subjects. The SCA8 phenotype manifested by cerebellar symptoms and atrophy corresponded to features of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA III).},

A discriminate analysis showed that 71.4 p. 100 of the cases were correctly classified. This model was validated within a new group of 21 patients and showed that the less severe dysarthric parkinsonian patients were difficult to distinguish from control subjects. The discriminate analysis was then used for 20 patients with atypical parkinsonism. Seven patients with progressive supranuclear palsy were considered to have hypokinetic dysarthria. The 6 patients with multisystem atrophy and 7 with corticobasal degeneration were classified among the 3 dysarthric types. We suggest that motor speech evaluation may contribute to differential diagnosis within groups of patients suffering from atypical parkinsonism.},

Individuals with SBH had more motor speech deficits than controls. Dysfluency was related to an interaction between chronological age and SBH. Speech rate was related independently to chronological age and SBH. Ataxic dysarthria was related to the biology of SBH, and was associated with both physical phenotype (level of spinal cord lesion) and medical history (number of shunt revisions). The data show that developmental as well as acquired lesions of the cerebellum disrupt motor speech, and add to the developmental role of the cerebellum in the automatization of motor skills, including speech.},

Intrinsic prosody is mediated largely through left hemisphere mechanisms and encompasses those elements of linguistic microstructure (e.g., syllabic magnitudes and durations, basic consonantal and vocalic gesture specifications, and so) that yield the segmental aspects of speech. Extrinsic prosody is processed primarily by right hemisphere (RH) mechanisms and involves manipulation of intonation across longer perceptual groupings. Intrinsic prosody deficits can lead to several core symptoms of speech apraxia such as difficulty with utterance initiation and syllable transitionalization and may lead to the establishment of inappropriate syllable boundaries. The intrinsic prosody profiles associated with acquired apraxia of speech, developmental speech apraxia, and ataxic dysarthria may aid in the clinical differentiation of these disorders.},

Results showed that the duration of pauses not associated with stop consonants can be modeled with two distinct lognormal distributions. The lognormal distribution predicted duration of across types within 1.67\% standard error, with the exception of pauses that occurred within phonemes. Distributional parameters pointed to some fundamental similarities between pauses that occur within words. The robustness of the lognormal distribution across pause types strongly supports this distribution as a viable and useful method of analysis.

Clinical descriptions of dysarthric features in cerebellar diseases, parametric investigations of ataxic dysarthria, and experimental studies in animals concerning the effects of lesions on vocalization and the representation of sensorimotor orofacial functions in the cerebellum are considered. Signs of cerebellar dysarthria include a slowing down of articulatory movements, increased variability of pitch and loudness, monotonous and “scanning” speech, and articulatory impreciseness. The available data indicate that the paramedian regions of the superior cerebellar hemispheres are relevant for the development of cerebellar dysarthria.},

  abstract = {Mutism has been associated with injury to midline cerebellar structures secondary to degenerative disease, tumors, hemorrhage, or surgery. Typically, cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) has been seen in children and only rarely described in adults after surgery of the posterior fossa. This syndrome typically arises 48 hours after the initiating event and resolves approximately 7 to 8 weeks later. Characteristics of CMS include complete absence of speech without impaired consciousness, other cranial nerve deficits, or long tract signs.The authors report on 2 patients each of whom developed cerebellar mutism after tumor resection using a posterior fossa approach. The first patient underwent gross total resection of a pineal region tumor via a supracerebellar approach. The second patient underwent posterior fossa decompression for a left cerebellar hemispheric renal cell carcinoma metastasis with adjacent hemorrhage. One patient displayed a variant of cerebellar mutism with severe ataxic dysarthria without complete absence of speech, whereas the other demonstrated frank mutism. After neuroimaging studies confirmed the absence of a surgically treatable postoperative cause for the patients' symptoms, they were managed in a supportive fashion (eg, speech therapy) and improved within 3.5 months and 1 year, respectively.It is paramount that neurosurgeons be aware of cerebellar mutism with regard to its very rare occurrence in adults, its time of onset, and typical self-limiting course.},

Prospective speech and language assessments were then conducted with 5 patients who had PCD. While ataxic dysarthria was the most common speech diagnosis, a spastic component was recognized frequently enough to suggest that the subacute (days to weeks) emergence and progression of an ataxic or mixed ataxic-spastic dysarthria in the setting of a more diffuse cerebellar ataxia should raise suspicions about PCD and justify further investigation of a possible immune-related etiology.},

Ataxia varied with tumor type/radiation. Medulloblastoma survivors had significantly more ataxic dysarthric features than either survivors of astrocytomas or controls, who did not differ from each other. Dysfluency varied with a history of a posterior fossa tumor. Medulloblastoma and astrocytoma survivors were each significantly more dysfluent than controls but did not differ from each other. Speech rate varied with age and tumor type. Adult controls were significantly faster than child controls, although adult tumor survivors were comparable to their child counterparts. Adult controls had significantly faster speech rates than adult survivors of medulloblastoma tumors. Ataxic dysarthric speech characteristics are more frequent in radiated survivors of medulloblastoma tumors than nonradiated survivors of astrocytoma tumors. Dysfluent and slow speech occur in cerebellar tumor survivors, regardless of tumor type and radiation history. Cerebellar tumors in childhood limit speech rate in adulthood.},

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) has been identified as being partly caused by a CTG expansion in an untranslated, endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1) gene. Clinically, SCA8 patients show similar features to those with the other SCAs, including limb and truncal ataxia, ataxic dysarthria and horizontal nystagmus, all of which are signs of dysfunction of the cerebellar system. However, allele sizes within the SCA8 proposed pathogenic range have been reported in patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in individuals from pedigrees with other SCA or Friedreich's ataxia, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or parkinsonism. These observations suggest that mutation of the SCA8 locus might affect neurons other than the cerebellum. Antisense transcripts are known to regulate complementary sense transcripts and are involved in several biologic functions, such as development, adaptive response, and viral infection. In order to test whether SCA8 affects the KLHL1 expression by antisense RNA in brain cells, we examined the expression pattern of KLHL1 and SCA8 in human tissues and in mouse brain regions. SCA8 expression was colocalized with KLHL1 transcript in many brain regions whose functions are correlated to the clinical symptoms of SCA8 patients. These findings lead to the hypothesis of a possible relevance that SCA8 transcript downregulates KLHL1 expression through an antisense mechanism, which then leads to SCA8 neuropathogenesis.},

Different variants of speech rhythm were imposed on sentence utterances obtained from two patients with ataxic dysarthria and two normal control speakers. For the sake of comparability the pitch contours were standardized by means of linearly interpolated stylized versions. The introduced manipulations significantly influenced the ratings of perceived slowness, dysfluency, and rhythmic adequacy. With respect to estimates of overall intelligibility and naturalness, however, ataxic-dysarthric utterances did not benefit from any synthetic changes. By contrast, utterances of normal speakers were rated less intelligible and somewhat more unnatural when resynthesized with an ataxic rhythm.

The findings are apparently different from those reported in the study of ataxic speech characteristics of the subjects speaking Germanic languages. Thus, the impression of “scanning” in Japanese ataxic subjects derives mainly from the breakdown of isochrony in terms of difficulty in keeping the length of segments (morae) of Japanese invariable during speech production.

There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. The features of the speech disturbance of these six major types of dysarthria are distinctive and can assist with diagnosis. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom of many neurological conditions and is commonly associated with progressive neurological disease. It has a profound effect upon the patient and their families as communication is integrally related with expressing personality and social relationships. Speech and language therapy can be used to encourage the person to use the speech that is already available to them more effectively, can increase the range and consistency of sound production, can teach strategies for improving intelligibility and communicative effectiveness, can guide the individual to use methods that are less tiring and more successful, and can introduce the appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication approaches as and when required.},

Method This is a case-control study of 32 children (66\% male) with galactosemia and neurologic speech disorders and 130 controls (50\% male) ages 4-16 years. Speech was assessed using the Percentage of Consonants Correct (PCC) metric from responses to the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2 and from a 5-min recorded speech sample, hand and tongue strength using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument, and coordination using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. The number of days on milk during the neonatal period was obtained by parent report. Analyses of covariance, distributions, and correlations were used to evaluate relationships among speech, strength, coordination, age, gender, and days on milk. Results Children with galactosemia had weaker hand and tongue strength and most (66\%) had significant coordination disorders, primarily affecting balance and manual dexterity. Among children with galactosemia, children with more speech errors and classified as childhood apraxia of speech (n = 7) and ataxic dysarthria (n = 1), had poorer balance and manual dexterity, but not weaker hand or tongue strength, compared to the children with fewer speech errors. The number of days on milk during the neonatal period was associated with more speech errors in males but not in females. Conclusion Children with galactosemia have a high prevalence of co-occurring speech, coordination, and strength disorders, which may be evidence of a common underlying etiology, likely associated with diffuse cerebellar damage, rather than distinct disorders.},

Results from both the force and position tasks suggested that the apraxic and dysarthric groups tended to produce significantly greater instability than the normal group, although the pattern of instability across articulators was not systematic within or across the force and position experiments for subjects within or between groups. The conduction aphasic group produced force and position stability that typically was not significantly different from any of the remaining three groups, suggesting that their force and position stability as indexed in the present study fell somewhere between that of the normal group and the apraxic and dysarthric groups. It is suggested that other analyses of force and position control, such as descriptive accounts of the trial-by-trial time histories, might shed additional light on the speech and orofacial sensorimotor control deficits in persons with apraxia, dysarthria, and conduction aphasia.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated the processes responsible for selection of sounds and syllables during production of speech sequences in 10 adults with hypokinetic dysarthria from Parkinson's disease, five adults with ataxic dysarthria, and 14 healthy control speakers. Speech production data from a choice reaction time task were analyzed to evaluate the effects of sequence length and practice on speech sound sequencing. Speakers produced sequences that were between one and five syllables in length over five experimental runs of 60 trials each. In contrast to the healthy speakers, speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria demonstrated exaggerated sequence length effects for both inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) and speech error rates. Conversely, speakers with ataxic dysarthria failed to demonstrate a sequence length effect on ISIs and were also the only group that did not exhibit practice-related changes in ISIs and speech error rates over the five experimental runs. The exaggerated sequence length effects in the hypokinetic speakers with Parkinson's disease are consistent with an impairment of action selection during speech sequence production. The absent length effects observed in the speakers with ataxic dysarthria is consistent with previous findings that indicate a limited capacity to buffer speech sequences in advance of their execution. In addition, the lack of practice effects in these speakers suggests that learning-related improvements in the production rate and accuracy of speech sequences involves processing by structures of the cerebellum. Together, the current findings inform models of serial control for speech in healthy speakers and support the notion that sequencing deficits contribute to speech symptoms in speakers with hypokinetic or ataxic dysarthria. In addition, these findings indicate that speech sequencing is differentially impaired in hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the effects of sequence complexity, defined in terms of phonemic similarity and phonotoactic probability, on the timing and accuracy of serial ordering for speech production in healthy speakers and speakers with either hypokinetic or ataxic dysarthria. Sequences were comprised of strings of consonant-vowel (CV) syllables with each syllable containing the same vowel, /a/, paired with a different consonant. High complexity sequences contained phonemically similar consonants, and sounds and syllables that had low phonotactic probabilities; low complexity sequences contained phonemically dissimilar consonants and high probability sounds and syllables. Sequence complexity effects were evaluated by analyzing speech error rates and within-syllable vowel and pause durations. This analysis revealed that speech error rates were significantly higher and speech duration measures were significantly longer during production of high complexity sequences than during production of low complexity sequences. Although speakers with dysarthria produced longer overall speech durations than healthy speakers, the effects of sequence complexity on error rates and speech durations were comparable across all groups. These findings indicate that the duration and accuracy of processes for selecting items in a speech sequence is influenced by their phonemic similarity and/or phonotactic probability. Moreover, this robust complexity effect is present even in speakers with damage to subcortical circuits involved in serial control for speech.},

Most desirable would be a causative treatment of the underlying cerebellar disease. This is currently available only for a very small subset of cerebellar ataxias with known metabolic dysfunction. However, increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of hereditary ataxia should lead to an increasing number of medically sensible drug trials. In this paper, data from recent drug trials in patients with recessive and dominant cerebellar ataxias will be summarized. There is consensus that up to date, no medication has been proven effective. Aminopyridines and acetazolamide are the only exception, which are beneficial in patients with episodic ataxia type 2. Aminopyridines are also effective in a subset of patients presenting with downbeat nystagmus. As such, all authors agreed that the mainstays of treatment of degenerative cerebellar ataxia are currently physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. For many years, well-controlled rehabilitation studies in patients with cerebellar ataxia were lacking. Data of recently published studies show that coordinative training improves motor function in both adult and juvenile patients with cerebellar degeneration. Given the well-known contribution of the cerebellum to motor learning, possible mechanisms underlying improvement will be outlined. There is consensus that evidence-based guidelines for the physiotherapy of degenerative cerebellar ataxia need to be developed. Future developments in physiotherapeutical interventions will be discussed including application of non-invasive brain stimulation.},

  abstract = {Although pontine strokes account for a small percentage of all ischaemic events, they can be associated with significant initial disability. These lesions may be missed on computed tomography and therefore magnetic resonance imaging is generally preferred for the assessment of brainstem strokes. The aetiopathogenesis of isolated pontine infarcts, not due to a significant compromise (occlusion or dissection) in the vertebrobasilar territory, still remains to be fully characterised. These strokes present with different symptoms, depending on the lesion location and size, partly reflecting the anatomical variability of the vertebrobasilar vessels. Progressive neurological deterioration is relatively common and has been associated with the extension of such lesions. However, many patients with significant infarcts in the pons will do well in the future and initial diffusion-weighted imaging may not add useful prognostication to the clinical assessment. We discuss here a case where an initially progressive presentation was associated with a marked improvement in both clinical and radiological assessments at 42 days. A 49-year-old white British man presented with left-sided weakness, incoordination, unsteadiness, cerebellar ataxic dysarthria and dysphonia. A baseline magnetic resonance imaging scan with diffusion-weighted imaging, T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences showed an acute bilateral pontine infarct. On a repeat scan at 42 days, there was a 57.5\% decrease in the size of the lesion on the high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted image and a corresponding improvement in the symptoms and the clinical assessments of this patient. The reduction in infarct size was also comparable to the decrease calculated between the baseline diffusion-weighted and the follow-up fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. This case report discusses the significant clinical improvement and corresponding lesion reduction in a patient that presented with worsening neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with acute bilateral ischaemic pontine infarction. Further studies, utilising structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging with follow-up scans, are needed to provide better insights into the underlying aetiopathology and recovery mechanisms of pontine stroke. These will help define the relationship between imaging parameters and outcome allowing for better prognosis along with the development of relevant rehabilitation programs for this group of patients.},

This syndrome should prompt lesional evaluation with neuroimaging focused on the dorsal midbrain, cerebellar outflow tracts, and thalamus. Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.},

Only a few observations, however, have been reported on the relation of ocular movements and facial muscles innervated by the facial nerve, especially the orbicularis oculi muscles. We report two cases presenting gaze-evoked involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle and unilateral eyelid closure. Case 1 was a 38-year-old housewife who was admitted to our hospital because of gait disturbance and sensory deficits below the neck. She had a 5-year history of left facial palsy, disturbed horizontal eye movements, retrobulbar optic neuritis, spastic paraparesis and bladder and rectal disturbances, some of which had relapsed a few times. Neurological abnormalities were summarized as follows: bilateral pale discs, right Horner's sign, horizontal nystagmus, left facial nerve palsy of peripheral type, spastic paraparesis with left-sided predominance, sensory disturbances below the third cervical segment, truncal and limb ataxia, and bladder and rectal disturbances. Gaze-linked synchronized contraction of the left facial muscles was observed and on the left lateral gaze marked spasm of the left orbicularis oculi muscle with occasional lid closure was evoked. Case 2 was a 72-year-old female with cerebellar hemorrhage. Neurological abnormal findings included mild disorientation, meningeal irritation signs, horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze, reduced response of reflex eye movement to the left, minimal weakness of the left facial muscles, ataxic dysarthria, mild left hemiparesis and hemisensory deficits with face, truncal and limb ataxia. She could move eyeballs to any direction but with effort to the left.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Oscillographic as well as photographic records of the speech acoustic signal were obtained to analyse interval for a syllable, which consisted of voiced and unvoiced intervals, and peak-value of voiced interval. The results were as follows: 1) ATAXICs and SPASTICs showed prolonged interval for a syllable, yet that of PARKINs was within normal range, when tested either in /a/ or in /pa/. 2) Standard deviation and coefficient of variation for intervals of syllable and those of peak-values in voiced interval could not distinguish their characteristics among ATAXICs, SPASTICs, and PARKINs. 3) In “on-off phonation test”, ATAXICs showed prolonged unvoiced intervals, while SPASTICs did prolonged voiced intervals. Results suggested that hypotonic laryngeal muscles in ATAXICs might result in prolongation of unvoiced interval, but that prolonged voiced interval related to biased hypertonus of laryngeal adductor. It is concluded that “on-off phonation test” could, with reasonable sensitivity, reflect the phonatory dynamics of laryngeal muscles in dysarthric patients.},

An analysis of clinical data is presented and inferences drawn. The propositus from pedigree-I (9-year-old female) could not walk stably and had a history of frequent falls. The symptoms aggravated over time until she lost the ability to take care of herself. Her physical and mental development (including cognitive ability) was normal. She had an ataxic gait, ataxic dysarthria, bilateral horizontal nystagmus and visible limb myoclonus. She failed the bilateral finger-to-nose and heel-knee-tibia tests and could not walk in a straight line. Babinski signs were not observed. EEG tracing during sleep showed low-amplitude spikes and spike-and-slow waves in the bilateral frontal and mid-frontal areas. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan was normal. In pedigree-II, the propositus (a 54-year-old male) could not walk stably and had a history of occasional falls for the past 34 years. The symptoms aggravated gradually until he lost the ability to perform routine daily activities. There was no history of convulsions. His physical and mental faculties, as well as the neurological findings were similar to those of the pedigree-I. Both proposituses did not respond well to symptomatic treatment. A novel mutation has been identified in SGCE gene (NM₀03919:exon3:c.360delT:p.A120fs) using exome sequencing. PMA patients from the two pedigrees had autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with variability in the age of onset and disease severity. The cardinal symptoms were myoclonic seizures and ataxia without mental retardation.},

The significantly slower than normal rate of repetition in the ataxic subjects and the significantly more variable than normal rhythm of repetition in the spastic subjects were unexpected findings and are in contrast with results from perceptually based investigations of dysarthria. The study demonstrates that slowness of syllable repetition is not restricted to spastic dysarthria and that dysrhythmia of syllable repetition is not restricted to ataxic dysarthria, thus suggesting the need for additional quantitative measurements of acoustic features on which certain notions about the dysarthrias are currently based.},

Currently there is little agreement in the clinical literature as to the locus or nature of processes involved in production and reception of prosody. This paper investigates the usefulness of two psycholinguistic models of prosody–involving “abstract” and “concrete” processes (Ladd \& Cutler, 1983)–in accounting for dysprosody following motor pathway as well as cortical lesions. Four groups of 10 adult patients each participated in the study; the first group had sustained a right cerebral hemisphere cortical stroke, the second group had hypokinetic dysarthria, the third group had ataxic dysarthria, and the fourth group was normal controls. Acoustic analysis using the Kay VisiPitch/PC was conducted on pairs of matched noun phrase and noun compounds (e.g., greenhouse, green house), interrogative and declarative versions of sentences, and sentences spoken in each of four different emotional tones. Right cerebral hemisphere damaged subjects produced shorter durations than the other groups for each stimulus class. However, all of the subjects were able to use duration to signal temporal information for the lexical distinction between noun compounds and noun phrases. The results are consistent with a model of prosodic control which involves both cortical as well as physiological control processes. Current treatment for dysprosody is discussed in light of this new emphasis on cognitive control processes.},

The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this intriguing entity remain obscure.},

  abstract = {The speech of 15 Taiwanese patients with cerebellar dysfunction and ataxic dysarthria was investigated utilizing techniques of acoustic analysis and instrumental measurement. Semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar function (SQACF) was also performed. The results of the acoustic analysis of the cerebellar speech were then correlated with the findings in the SQACF. The overlapping of voice onset time highly correlates with truncal ataxia as well as eye movement abnormality and eye-hand coordination. The prolongation of vowel duration also correlates significantly with tandem walking, dysdiadochokinesia and eye movement abnormality. The correlation of the speech function with other cerebellar motor functions provides further insight into the functional anatomy for cerebellar speech motor control. This study concludes that the midline structures-vermis and fastigial nucleus-seem to be the primary focus for the coordination of motor speech in the cerebellum.},

  abstract = {We report a 30-year-old man with adult type adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) who manifested an acute onset and repeated episodes of ataxic dysarthria. He noticed a moderate dysarthria after a high grade fever in February of 1995; however, two weeks later his symptom disappeared completely. Three months later, he noticed the dysarthria again and he was referred to our hospital for further examination. General physical findings on admission revealed a dark skin color, pigmentation of gingivae and reduced body hair. Neurologically he was normal except for a moderate ataxic dysarthria. Cranial T2-weighted MRI showed multiple high intensity lesions in the subcortical white matter of frontal lobe, bilateral peritrigonal white matter, splenium of the corpus callosum and bilateral cerebellar white matter. Only cerebellar lesions responsible for his symptom were enhanced on MRI after gadolinium administration. Initially we diagnosed him with multiple sclerosis (MS) based upon the clinical course and MRI findings, and then started corticosteroid treatment. His dysarthria was slightly improved after the treatment and bilateral gadolinium-enhanced lesions of cerebellar white matter on MRI disappeared. Multimodality evoked potentials such as short latency somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials, disclosed a prolonged central conduction time associated with bilaterally symmetric individual interpeak latencies. These findings, which supported diffuse and bilateral subclinical demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system, were unusual for MS; therefore his plasma very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) were assayed for ALD. Finally, he was diagnosed with adult type ALD because of the high ratio of C26: 0/C22: 0 (0.075; normal 0.033). It is very difficult to clinically distinguish the early stage of adult type ALD especially in patients like this from MS. Therefore it is useful and important to evaluate not only the level of plasma VLCFA, but also to evaluate multimodality evoked potentials.},

Slow speech rate was a specific feature, but scanning speech and irregular articulatory breakdown (i.e., prominent characteristics in adult ataxic dysarthria) were not observed. In the second group, hypernasality was a prominent characteristic and resembled flaccid dysarthria in adults.

Treating dysarthria, dysphagia, and cognitive deficits in MS patients is effective for reestablishing functional daily activities. The types, severity, and rates of deterioration in MS are highly variable; complete restoration to normal functioning is therefore not always expected. For these reasons, careful documentation of clinical-treatment outcomes and the factors influencing these outcomes should be regularly collected and reported.},

  abstract = {Targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) using standard stereotactic coordinates in conjunction with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally results in effective symptomatic relief for the cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The angle of approach, however, influences the resultant field of stimulation and can lead to undesired side effects. We review a case where symptomatic improvement was accompanied by significant side effects despite reasonable STN stereotactic base coordinates. Revision of the lead using similar base coordinates but a significantly different angle of approach greatly improved the outcome. Stimulation ventromedial to the STN improved tremors but brought about dysarthria and dystonia. Computer-based stimulation field modeling helped understand the regions associated with the side effects and illustrate the difference between pre- and post-revision stimulation fields. Lead angle can impact DBS outcome and should be taken into consideration.}

  abstract = {Speakers of intonation languages use bundles of cues to express prosodic prominence. This work contributes further evidence for the multi-dimensionality of prosodic prominence in German reporting articulatory (3D EMA) and acoustic recordings from 27 speakers. In particular, we show that speakers use specific categorical and continuous modifications of the laryngeal system (tonal onglide) as well as continuous modifications of the supra-laryngeal system (lip aperture and tongue body position) to mark focus structure prosodically. These modifications are found between unaccented and accented but also within the group of accented words, revealing that speakers use prosodic modulations to directly encode prominence. On the basis of these findings we develop a dynamical model of prosodic patterns that is able to capture the manipulations as the modulation of an attractor landscape that is shaped by the different prosodic dimensions involved.},

All subjects showed a number of signs of decreased speech rate, increased pause duration, increased and more variable durations of alternating motion rate, sequential motion rate syllables and inter-stress intervals in addition to vocal instability. These signs were consistent with the perceptual judgment of ataxic dysarthria. Furthermore, the severity of impairment found using these speech analysis methods seemed to correspond to the general severity of the disease and the duration of the illness in these few subjects.

In the present study speech samples from 21 subjects with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and 21 matched control subjects were analyzed using perceptual and acoustic methodology. Dysarthria assessment showed that subjects had mild or mild-moderate dysarthria. Perceptual analysis indicated that equalized stress, imprecise consonants, vocal instability, monotony and reduced speech rate were the speech parameters that yielded the highest mean perceptual ratings. A factor analysis of perceptual speech parameters revealed two main factors: Factor 1 was associated with articulatory timing and Factor 2 with vocal quality. Acoustic analysis revealed significantly reduced speech rate during text reading, reduced alternating and sequential motion rates (AMR/SMR), significantly longer and more variable syllable and pause durations, and significantly higher vocal instability for subjects with SCA compared to control subjects.},

  abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias clinically characterized by progressive ataxia, dysarthria and a range of other concomitant neurological symptoms. Only a few studies include detailed characterization of speech symptoms in SCA. Speech symptoms in SCA resemble ataxic dysarthria but symptoms related to phonation may be more prominent. One study to date has shown an association between differences in speech and voice symptoms related to genotype. More studies of speech and voice phenotypes are motivated, to possibly aid in clinical diagnosis. In addition, instrumental speech analysis has been demonstrated to be a reliable measure that may be used to monitor disease progression or therapy outcomes in possible future pharmacological treatments. Intervention by speech and language pathologists should go beyond assessment. Clinical guidelines for management of speech, communication and swallowing need to be developed for individuals with progressive cerebellar ataxia.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the extent to which speakers manipulate featural distinctions when trying to clarify misunderstood speech, focusing on voicing contrasts in stops and height and backness (represented by F1 and F2) and durational contrasts in vowels. Participants interacted with a simulated speech recognizer, repeating words when they were “guessed” incorrectly. Both phonemically voiced and voiceless stops showed more extreme VOT values when elicited by an incorrect guess in which the consonant was a minimal pair in voicing with the target consonant (e.g. subject reads “bit”, computer guesses “pit”), but not when elicited by an open-ended request for repetition (e.g. subject reads “bit”, computer guesses “What did you say?”). A follow-up study showed that the change in VOT between the two repetitions was only present when the incorrect guess contrasted in voicing, but not when it contrasted in place or manner. In contrast, for vowels, the amount and direction of formant change in the F1–F2 space was not significantly different from zero for either type of incorrect guess. However, when there was a durational component to the vowel contrast (/i/ vs. =ɪ=), speakers exaggerated the durational differences between the segments, as opposed to when there was not a durational contrast (e.g. /i/ vs. /u/). The results show that speakers perform local, systematic, and phonologically informed manipulations of temporal contrasts online when clarifying phonetic segments.},

In this context, the contrastive FOCUS shows not only a L+H* pitch accent, but also a following phonological phrase break, marked by both a L- phrase accent and temporal disjuncture. In the same context, presentational focus shows a pitch accent H* and no phonological phrase break (no L- and no disjuncture). Since these differences in prosody correlating with different Focus types are not plausibly construed as the realization of distinct tonal morphemes, I suggest that the contrastive/presentational contrast is present in the interface informational/syntactic structure itself, and makes itself felt in the phonological representation through the action of syntax-phonology interface constraints which distinguish the two Focus types.},

  abstract = {Articulatory rate and pause time in a standardized reading task in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in correlation to disease duration and severity as compared to healthy controls were analyzed. In 121 PD patients and 70 healthy controls, an acoustical analysis was performed on the first and last sentence of a standardized 170-syllabic text, using a commercial audio software. Articulatory rate and speech to pause ratios were calculated by measuring the length of each syllable and each pause both at the end of words and within polysyllabic words. No significant difference in overall articulatory rate was found between PD patients and controls. Both groups showed an accelerated speech rate in the last sentence compared to the first; however, PD patients had a higher speech acceleration than did controls. PD patients exhibited a significantly reduced percental pause duration in relation to total speech time in the first sentence and a reduced percental pause time within polysyllabic words. PD patients made significantly less but longer pauses at the end of words and less pauses within polysyllabic words. UPDRS III showed an inverse relation to number and rate of intraword pauses, and disease duration was negatively correlated with articulatory rate. The characteristics of parkinsonian speech feature was not only a stronger acceleration of articulation rate in the course of speaking but also a significant reduction of the total numbers of pauses, indicating an impaired speech rhythm and timing organization.},

  abstract = {Explorative analysis of prosodic parameters in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and in healthy controls in correlation to gender, disease-specific parameters, and motor symptoms. Acoustical analysis was performed on 169 patients with PD and 64 age-matched healthy controls based on a four sentence-reading task. Assessment of motor impairment was performed on the basis of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale/Motor Score III and further symp- tom-related subscores. F0 variability was reduced in male and female PD patients, whereas meanF0 was found to be elevated in male patients with PD only. No significant difference in overall articulatory rate was found between PD patients and controls, but patients showed a reduction of percentual pause time within polysyllabic words (Pinw\%). Female PD patients showed an additional reduction of percentual pause ratio (PR\%). Variables of intonation and artic- ulatory rate were not correlated to each other. Strong correlations were seen between some distinct prosodic variables and the axial and akinesia parkinsonian symptoms with some gender-related particularities. Reduction of F0 variability and Pinw\% are the most conspicuous features of parkinsonian dysprosody with some further gender-related characteristics. Changes of intonation variability and speech velocity seem to be controlled by different pathophysiological conditions. In consideration of some gender differences, several distinct aspects of dysprosody can be interpreted as axial and akinesia symptoms of PD.},

  abstract = {Purpose               This study investigated acoustic–phonetic modifications produced in noise-adapted speech (NAS) and clear speech (CS) by children, young adults, and older adults.                                         Method               Ten children (11–13 years of age), 10 young adults (18–29 years of age), and 10 older adults (60–84 years of age) read sentences in conversational and clear speaking style in quiet and in noise. A number of acoustic measurements were obtained.                                         Results               NAS and CS were characterized by a decrease in speaking rate and an increase in 1–3 kHz energy, sound pressure level (SPL), vowel space area (VSA), and harmonics-to-noise ratio. NAS increased fundamental frequency (F0) mean and decreased jitter and shimmer. CS increased frequency and duration of pauses. Older adults produced the slowest speaking rate, longest pauses, and smallest increase in F0 mean, 1–3 kHz energy, and SPL when speaking clearly. They produced the smallest increases in VSA in NAS and CS. Children slowed down less, increased the VSA least, increased harmonics-to-noise ratio, and decreased jitter and shimmer most in CS. Children increased mean F0 and F1 most in noise.                                         Conclusions               Findings have implications for a model of speech production in healthy speakers as well as the potential to aid in clinical decision making for individuals with speech disorders, particularly dysarthria.},

The varied presentation of this dysarthria challenges researchers and clinicians alike, and brings into question whether it is a single entity. While the possibility of subtypes of ataxic dysarthria has been suggested, the nature of these putative groups remains unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if perceptual speech characteristics would align with a pattern of unusual variability or unusual consistency across speech subsystems and speaking tasks. A framework of speech characteristics was created from the existing literature that clustered speech attributes according to notions of instability (unusual variability) or inflexibility (unusual consistency). These speech features were used to develop a perceptual rating form. Ten experienced speech-language pathologists listened to pre-recorded, exemplary samples of 10 speakers with ataxic dysarthria and rated the perceptual speech features. Results suggested that five speakers fit the pattern of instability, one speaker aligned with inflexibility and four speakers had a mixed presentation. Intra-rater reliability was satisfactory. This study adds to the sparse, yet growing, literature to support the existence of subgroups in ataxic dysarthria. The more frequent occurrence of the instability profile is consistent with primary disruption to the timing function of the cerebellar circuit. Identification of subgroups has important clinical and research implications and further research is warranted.},

  abstract = {The question of if and to what extent listeners’ perceptual phonetic categories are sensitive to prosodically driven variability has been a topic of interest in the literature. The present study reports on two experiments which address this question in light of recent research. In Experiment 1, listeners categorized a VOT continuum as /p/ or /b/ in a target syllable (/pɑ/ or /bɑ/). The target was placed in a carrier phrase where the duration and f0 of the pre-target syllable were manipulated. Results suggest listeners are sensitive to intonational structure in their computation of speech rate, interpreting a short syllable with low-rising f0 (created from an L-H\% boundary tone in English intonational phonology) as an increase in speech rate. This perceived increase in rate shifts the category boundary of the subsequent target VOT. Experiment 2 showed listeners similarly adjusted categorization of a vowel duration continuum, where vowel duration is a cue to a following obstruent’s voicing (categorized as "coat" or "code"). Taken together, these results suggest that listeners are sensitive to intonational structure in their perception of segmental contrasts and use the distribution of tonal targets over a given temporal interval in computing speech rate.},

According to this framework, hypokinetic, hyperkinetic and ataxic dysarthria are programming-execution dysarthrias, while flaccid dysarthria is the only execution dysarthria. This preliminary study aimed to differentiate programming-execution dysarthria from execution dysarthria by examining variability of the temporal control of speech. Six participants and five control participants repeated 15 stimulus words ten times. Voice onset time, vowel duration, vowel steady state duration and vowel formant transition duration were measured acoustically. The coefficient of variation of the temporal parameters, and the correlation coefficient between the durational parameters, were calculated and analysed using descriptive statistics. The coefficient of variation revealed that the speakers with dysarthria were more variable than the control speakers. All participants, except those with flaccid dysarthria, showed similar patterns of intra-subject variability. Those with flaccid dysarthria exhibited greater intra-subject variability of voice onset time. The correlation analysis did not reveal differences between dysarthria type, or between the dysarthric speakers and the controls. Differences found in the patterns of variability may support the hypothesis that individuals with programming-execution dysarthria resort to a different level of control than those with execution dysarthria. Further research in this field is necessary.},

  institution = {{University of Colorado at Boulder}},
  abstract = {Although much is known about the linguistic function of vowel nasality, either contrastive (as in French) or coarticulatory (as in English), less is known about its perception. This study uses careful examination of production patterns, along with data from both machine learning and human listeners to establish which acoustical features are useful (and used) for identifying vowel nasality. A corpus of 4,778 oral and nasal or nasalized vowels in English and French was collected, and feature data for 29 potential perceptual features was extracted. A series of Linear Mixed-Effects Regressions showed 7 promising features with large oral-to-nasal feature differences, and highlighted some cross-linguistic differences in the relative importance of these features. Two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and RandomForests, were trained on this data to identify features or feature groupings that were most effective at predicting nasality token-by-token in each language. The list of promising features was thus narrowed to four: A1-P0, Vowel Duration, Spectral Tilt, and Formant Frequency/Bandwidth. These four features were manipulated in vowels in oral and nasal contexts in English, adding nasal features to oral vowels and reducing nasal features in nasalized vowels, in an attempt to influence oral/nasal classification. These stimuli were presented to native English listeners in a lexical choice task with phoneme masking, measuring oral/nasal classification accuracy and reaction time. Only modifications to vowel formant structure caused any perceptual change for listeners, resulting in increased reaction times, as well as increased oral/nasal confusion in the oral-to-nasal (feature addition) stimuli. Classification of already-nasal vowels was not affected by any modifications, suggesting a perceptual role for other acoustical characteristics alongside nasality-specific cues. A Support Vector Machine trained on the same stimuli showed a similar pattern of sensitivity to the experimental modifications. Thus, based on both the machine learning and human perception results, formant structure, particularly F1 bandwidth, appears to be the primary cue to the perception of nasality in English. This close relationship of nasal- and oral-cavity derived acoustical cues leads to a strong perceptual role for both the oral and nasal aspects of nasal vowels.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice and speech disorders are one of the most important issues after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Objective: We studied the articulation features of PD patients with STN-DBS. Methods: Participants were 56 PD patients treated with STN-DBS (STN-DBS group) and 41 patients treated only with medical therapy (medical-therapy-alone group). Articulation function was evaluated with acoustic and auditory-perceptual analyses. The vowel space area (VSA) was calculated using the formant frequency data of three vowels (/a/, /i/, and /u/) from sustained phonation task. The VSA reportedly reflects the distance of mouth/jaw and tongue movements during speech and phonation. Correlations between acoustic and auditory-perceptual measurements were also assessed. Results: The VSA did not significantly differ between the medical-therapy-alone group and the STN-DBS group in the off-stimulation condition. In the STN-DBS group, the VSA was larger in the on-stimulation condition than in the off-stimulation condition. However, individual analysis showed the VSA changes after stopping stimulation were heterogeneous. In total, 89.8\% of the STN-DBS group showed a large VSA size in the on- than in the off-stimulation condition. In contrast, the VSA of the remaining patients in that group was smaller in the on- than the off-stimulation condition. Conclusions: STN-DBS may resolve hypokinesia of the articulation structures, including the mouth/jaw and tongue, and improve maximal vowel articulation. However, in the on-stimulation condition, the VSA was not significantly correlated with speech intelligibility. This may be because STN-DBS potentially affects other speech processes such as voice and/or respiratory process.},

  abstract = {Previous research indicates that talkers differ in phonetically relevant properties of speech, including voice-onset-time (VOT) in word-initial stop consonants; some talkers have characteristically shorter VOTs than others. Previous research also indicates that VOT is robustly affected by contextual influences, including speaking rate and place of articulation. This paper examines whether these contextual influences on VOT are themselves talker-specific. Many tokens of alveolar ∕ti∕ (experiment 1) or labial ∕pi∕ and velar ∕ki∕ (experiment 2) were elicited from talkers across a range of rates. VOT and vowel duration (a metric of rate) were measured for each token. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that (1) VOT increased as rate decreased for all talkers, but the magnitude of the increase varied significantly across talkers; thus the effect of rate on VOT was talker-specific; (2) the talker-specific effect of rate was stable across a change in place of articulation; and (3) for all talkers VOTs were shorter for labial than velar stops, and there was no significant variability in the magnitude of this displacement across talkers; thus the effect of place on VOT was not talker-specific. The implications of these findings for how listeners might accommodate talker differences in VOT during speech perception are discussed.},

  abstract = {Both rate reduction and increased loudness reportedly are associated with an increase in the size of the articulatory-acoustic working space and improved acoustic distinctiveness for speakers with dysarthria. Improved intelligibility also has been reported. Few studies have directly compared rate and loudness effects for speakers with dysarthria, however, although rate reduction and increasing vocal loudness are common treatment techniques. In the current study, 15 speakers with dysarthria secondary to multiple sclerosis, 12 speakers with dysarthria secondary to Parkinson's disease (PD), and 15 healthy controls read a passage in habitual, loud, and slow conditions. Rate and loudness variations were elicited using magnitude production. Acoustic measures included articulatory rate, sound pressure level, vowel space area, first moment difference measures, and F2 trajectory characteristics for diphthongs. Ten listeners scaled intelligibility for reading passages produced by the speakers with dysarthria. Relationships between intelligibility estimates and acoustic measures were determined by regression analysis. All speaker groups reduced articulatory rate for the slow condition and increased vocal intensity for the loud condition, relative to the habitual condition. Vowel acoustic distinctiveness, as indexed by vowel space area, was maximized in the slow condition, but stop consonant acoustic distinctiveness, as indexed by first moment difference measures, was maximized in the loud condition. F2 slope measures for diphthongs were not consistently affected by rate or loudness. Scaled intelligibility for speakers with PD also improved in the loud condition relative to both the habitual and slow conditions. Intelligibility estimates for speakers with dysarthria, however, were not strongly related to acoustic measures of supraglottal behavior. Findings are compared with previous studies, and hypotheses for future treatment studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that lax vowels may be relatively unaffected by dysarthria, owing to the reduced vocal tract shapes required for these phonetic events (G. S. Turner, K. Tjaden, \& G. Weismer, 1995). It also has been suggested that lax vowels may be especially susceptible to speech mode effects (M. A. Picheny, N. I. Durlach, \& L. D. Braida, 1986). Studies evaluating these suggestions are lacking, however. The present study was an initial investigation of the vowel space area formed by the lax vowels /Iota/, /epsilon/, and /upsilon/, occurring in a passage read in habitual, fast, and slow conditions by speakers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls. Vowel space areas for speakers with ALS but not speakers with PD differed from those for the appropriate control group. Thus, only the results for the PD group support the hypothesis that lax vowel space areas for speakers with dysarthria should be similar to those for neurologically normal talkers. Compared with the habitual condition, rate reduction was associated with an expanded vowel space area for all of the healthy talkers but for only about half of the speakers with dysarthria. In addition, about half of the speakers in each group demonstrated a reduced vowel space area for the fast condition relative to the habitual condition, although the statistical analyses indicated no difference in vowel space areas for the fast and habitual conditions. The current study therefore provides only limited support for the idea that lax vowels are highly susceptible to speech mode effects, at least when the speech modes under consideration include faster-than-normal and slower-than normal rates. Clinical implications are discussed.},

Reduced speech intelligibility is a significant functional limitation of dysarthria, and in the case of PD is likely related articulatory and phonatory impairment. Prosodically-based treatments show the most promise for addressing these deficits as well as for maximizing speech intelligibility. Communication-oriented strategies also may help to enhance mutual understanding between a speaker and listener. Dysphagia in PD can result in serious health issues, including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. Early identification of swallowing abnormalities is critical so as to minimize the impact of dysphagia on health status and quality of life. Feeding modifications, compensatory strategies, and therapeutic swallowing techniques all have a role in the management of dysphagia in PD.},

More generally, the current study sought to compare and contrast how a slower- than-normal rate and increased vocal loudness impact on a variety of utterance-level F0 characteristics for speakers with dysarthria and healthy controls. Patients and Methods: Eleven speakers with Parkinson's disease, 15 speakers with multiple sclerosis, and 14 healthy control speakers were audio recorded while reading a passage in habitual, loud, and slow conditions. Magnitude production was used to elicit variations in rate and loudness. Acoustic measures of duration, intensity and F0 were obtained. Results and Conclu- sions: For all speaker groups, a slower-than-normal articulatory rate and increased vocal loudness had distinct effects on F0 relative to the habitual condition, including a tendency for measures of F0 variation to be greater in the loud condi- tion and reduced in the slow condition. These results sug- gest implications for the treatment of dysarthria.},

The extent to which these types of tasks and procedures reflect intelligibility for extemporaneous speech is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to compare intelligibility estimates obtained for a reading passage and an extemporaneous monologue produced by 12 speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between structural characteristics of utterances and scaled intelligibility was explored within speakers. Speakers were audio-recorded while reading a paragraph and producing a monologue. Speech samples were separated into individual utterances for presentation to 70 listeners who judged intelligibility using orthographic transcription and direct magnitude estimation (DME). Results suggest that scaled estimates of intelligibility for reading show potential for indexing intelligibility of an extemporaneous monologue. Within-speaker variation in scaled intelligibility also was related to the number of words per speech run for extemporaneous speech.},

  abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to investigate how speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) accomplish voluntary reductions in speech rate. A group of talkers with no history of neurological disease was included for comparison. This study was motivated by the idea that knowledge of how speakers with dysarthria voluntarily accomplish a reduced speech rate would contribute toward a descriptive model of speaking rate change in dysarthria. Such a model has the potential to assist in identifying rate control strategies to receive focus in clinical treatment programs and also would advance understanding of global speech timing in dysarthria. All speakers read a passage in Habitual and Slow conditions. Speech rate, articulation rate, pause duration, and pause frequency were measured. All speaker groups adjusted articulation time as well as pause time to reduce overall speech rate. Group differences in how voluntary rate reduction was accomplished were primarily one of quantity or degree. Overall, a slower-than-normal rate was associated with a reduced articulation rate, shorter speech runs that included fewer syllables, and longer more frequent pauses. Taken together, these results suggest that existing skills or strategies used by patients should be emphasized in dysarthria training programs focusing on rate reduction. Results further suggest that a model of voluntary speech rate reduction based on neurologically normal speech shows promise as being applicable for mild to moderate dysarthria.},

  abstract = {Face masks are an important tool for preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, it is unclear how different types of masks affect speech recognition in different levels of background noise. To address this, we investigated the effects of four masks (a surgical mask, N95 respirator, and two cloth masks) on recognition of spoken sentences in multi-talker babble. In low levels of background noise, masks had little to no effect, with no more than a 5.5\% decrease in mean accuracy compared to a no-mask condition. In high levels of noise, mean accuracy was 2.8-18.2\% lower than the no-mask condition, but the surgical mask continued to show no significant difference. The results demonstrate that different types of masks generally yield similar accuracy in low levels of background noise, but differences between masks become more apparent in high levels of noise.},

  abstract = {Predictability is known to affect many properties of speech production. In particular, it has been observed that highly predictable elements (words, syllables) are produced with less phonetic prominence (shorter duration, less peripheral vowels) than less predictable elements. This tendency has been proposed to be a general property of language. This paper examines whether predictability is correlated with fundamental frequency (F0) production, through analysis of experimental corpora of American English. Predictability was variously defined as discourse mention, utterance probability, and semantic focus. The results revealed consistent effects of utterance probability and semantic focus on F0, in the expected direction: less predictable words were produced with a higher F0 than more predictable words. However, no effect of discourse mention was observed. These results provide further empirical support for the generalization that phonetic prominence is inversely related to linguistic predictability. In addition, the divergent results for different predictability measures suggests that the parameterization of predictability within a particular experimental design can have significant impact on the interpretation of results, and that it cannot be assumed that two measures necessarily reflect the same cognitive reality.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a 2-week intensive coordinative motor training on speech production. Speech and motor performances in a cohort of ten individuals with cerebellar degeneration were examined three times; before the introduction of training, directly and 4 weeks after the last training session. Each patient was instructed to perform a speaking task of fast syllable repetition and monologue. Objective acoustic analyses were used to investigate six key aspects of speech production disturbed in ataxic dysarthria including accuracy of consonant articulation, accuracy of vowel articulation, irregular alternating motion rates, prolonged phonemes, slow alternating motion rates and inappropriate segmentation. We found that coordinative training had a mild beneficial effect on speech in cerebellar patients. Immediately after the last training session, slight speech improvements were evident in all ten patients. Furthermore, follow-up assessment performed 4 weeks later revealed that 90\% of the patients showed better speech performance than before initiation of the therapy. The present study supports evidence that the intensive rehabilitative training may positively affect fine-motor movements such as speech in patients with cerebellar ataxia.},

Here, the patterns and degree of consonant articulation deficits across voiced and voiceless stop plosives in 16 PD, 16 PSP, 16 MSA and 16 healthy control speakers were evaluated using acoustic and perceptual methods. Imprecise consonant articulation was observed across all Parkinsonian groups. Voice onset time of voiceless plosives was more prolonged in both PSP and MSA compared to PD, presumably due to greater severity of dysarthria and slower articulation rate. Voice onset time of voiced plosives was signif- icantly shorter only in MSA, likely as a consequence of damage to cerebellar structures. In agreement with the reduction of pre-voicing, MSA manifested increased number of voiced plosives misclassified as voice- less at perceptual evaluation. Timing of articulatory movements may provide important clues about the pathophysiology of underlying disease.},

  abstract = {Acoustical measures of vocal function are routinely used in the assessments of disordered voice, and for monitoring the patient's progress over the course of voice therapy. Typically, acoustic measures are extracted from sustained vowel stimuli where short-term and long-term perturbations in fundamental frequency and intensity, and the level of “glottal noise” are used to characterize the vocal function. However, acoustic measures extracted from continuous speech samples may well be required for accurate prediction of abnormal voice quality that is relevant to the client's “real world” experience. In contrast with sustained vowel research, there is relatively sparse literature on the effectiveness of acoustic measures extracted from continuous speech samples. This is partially due to the challenge of segmenting the speech signal into voiced, unvoiced, and silence periods before features can be extracted for vocal function characterization. In this paper we propose a joint time-frequency approach for classifying pathological voices using continuous speech signals that obviates the need for such segmentation. The speech signals were decomposed using an adaptive time-frequency transform algorithm, and several features such as the octave max, octave mean, energy ratio, length ratio, and frequency ratio were extracted from the decomposition parameters and analyzed using statistical pattern classification techniques. Experiments with a database consisting of continuous speech samples from 51 normal and 161 pathological talkers yielded a classification accuracy of 93.4\%.},

  abstract = {Information from different bio–signals such as speech, hand- writing, and gait have been used to monitor the state of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, however, all the multi- modal bio–signals may not always be available. We propose a method based on multi-view representation learning via generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) for learn- ing a representation of features extracted from handwriting and gait that can be used as a complement to speech–based features. Three different problems are addressed: classi- fication of PD patients vs. healthy controls, prediction of the neurological state of PD patients according to the UP- DRS score, and the prediction of a modified version of the Frenchay dysarthria assessment (m-FDA). According to the results, the proposed approach is suitable to improve the re- sults in the addressed problems, specially in the prediction of the UPDRS, and m-FDA scores.},

This study presents quantitative anatomic data on the growth of the oral and pharyngeal portions of the VT from 605 imaging studies for individuals between birth and 19 years. The oral (horizontal) portion of the VT was segmented into lip-thickness, anterior-cavity-length, oropharyngeal-width, and VT-oral; and the pharyngeal (vertical) portion of the VT into posterior-cavity-length, and nasopharyngeal-length. The data were analyzed to determine growth trend, growth rate and growth type (neural or somatic). Findings indicate differences in the growth trend of segments/variables analyzed, with significant sex differences for all variables except anterior-cavity-length. While the growth trend of some variables display prepubertal sex differences at specific age ranges, the importance of such localized differences appears to be masked by overall growth rate differences between males and females. Finally, assessment of growth curve type indicates that most VT structures follow a combined/hybrid (somatic and neural) growth curve with structures in the vertical plane having a predoMinantly somatic growth pattern. these data on the non-uniform growth of the vocal tract reveal anatomic differences that contribute to documented acoustic differences in prepubertal speech production.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that lesions of the basal ganglia frequently result in dysarthria, in part because many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired speech. Earlier studies of speech production in PD using perceptual, acoustic, and/or kinematic analyses have yielded mixed findings about the characteristics of articulatory movements underlying hypokinetic dysarthria associated with PD: in some cases reporting reduced articulatory output, and in other instances revealing orofacial movement parameters within the normal range. The central aim of this experiment was to address these inconsistencies by providing an integrative description of basic kinematic and acoustic parameters of speech production in individuals with PD. Recordings of lip and jaw movements and acoustic data were collected in 16 individuals with PD and 16 age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy older adults. Our results revealed a downscaling of articulatory dynamics in the individuals with PD, evidenced by decreased amplitude and velocity of lower lip and jaw movements, decreased vocal intensity (dB sound pressure level [SPL]), and reduced second formant (F2) slopes. However, speech rate did not differ between groups. Our finding of an overall downscaling of speech movement and acoustic parameters in some participants with PD provides support for speech therapies directed at increasing speech effort in individuals with PD.},

  abstract = {The speech of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically characterized as lacking in proper prosody because of its monopitch and monoloud quality, in addition to its reduced intensity. These qualities make it difficult for others to understand speakers with PD. The purpose of the current study was to identify what individuals with PD would do vocally, if anything at all, to improve speech production following a simulated misunderstanding of what they had just said. The study evaluated the performance of 5 individuals with PD and compared their performance to 5 age- and sex-matched controls. Specifically, measures of vocal intensity (loudness), fundamental frequency (pitch), and utterance duration were made for repetitions of a `misheard' phrase. In one experimental condition noise was presented through headphones to induce the Lombard effect. Both individuals with PD and controls used increased duration as a means of enhancing clarity in a repetition. Fundamental frequency (F0) and sound pressure level (SPL) were not consistently modified in repetitions for clarification. Under most speaking conditions, individuals with PD and controls had similar F0 and SPL. Individuals with PD, like the controls, responded to the presentation of masking noise by increasing their fundamental frequency and their intensity. Therefore, not all individuals with PD exhibit difficulty using prosody.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, it has been assumed that emphasis is used to signal that information in a conversation is new, focused, or important. In this chapter, evidence from three sets of experiments suggests that emphasis is the product of a number of different factors that can affect the acoustic prominence of a word in different ways. I present evidence that (1) emphasis can vary continuously, not categorically; (2) differing factors like difficulty of production and informational importance have different effects on how emphasis is acoustically realized; and (3) listeners do not treat all acoustic correlates of emphasis equally when processing speech, suggesting that they are sensitive to the fact that emphasis is the product of multiple sources. These findings suggest that rather than being a unitary linguistic or psychological construct, emphasis is the product of an array of different cognitive and linguistic factors.},

To investigate whether these factors are independent or two aspects of the same phenomenon, na¨ıve participants played a verbal variant of Tic Tac Toe. Both importance and predictability contributed independently to the acoustic prominence of a word, but in different ways. Predictable game moves were shorter in duration and had less pitch excursion than less predictable game moves, whereas intensity was higher for important game moves. These data also suggest that acoustic prominence is affected by both speaker-centered processes (speaker effort) and listener-centered processes (intent to signal important information to the listener).},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate measures of speech production that could be used to document effects of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) on speech performance, especially in persons with Parkinson disease (PD). A small set of evaluative criteria for these measures is presented first, followed by consideration of several speech physiology and speech acoustic measures that have been studied frequently and reported on in the literature on normal speech production, and speech production affected by neuromotor disorders (dysarthria). Each measure is reviewed and evaluated against the evaluative criteria. Embedded within this review and evaluation is a presentation of new data relating speech motions to speech intelligibility measures in speakers with PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and control speakers (CS). These data are used to support the conclusion that at the present time the slope of second formant transitions (F2 slope), an acoustic measure, is well suited to make inferences to speech motion and to predict speech intelligibility. The use of other measures should not be ruled out, however, and we encourage further development of evaluative criteria for speech measures designed to probe the effects of DBS or any treatment with potential effects on speech production and communication skills.},

  abstract = {Undergraduate statistics courses are perceived as challenging by both students and instructors. Students? attitudes, motivation, math anxiety, and preparedness can negatively impact the student and instructor experience and have the potential to negatively impact student learning. This article describes an attempt to address some of these challenges through structural and procedural changes to an undergraduate statistics course that is required for social science majors. The traditional lecture/homework structure of the course was ?flipped? so that the majority of basic knowledge acquisition moved out of the classroom, making room for interactive activities during class time. The described changes had a positive impact on students? attitudes toward the class and instructor as well as on students? performance in the class.},

  n2 = {Objectives: Slowed speaking rate was examined for its effects on speech intelligibility, its interaction with the benefit of contextual cues, and the impact of these factors on listening effort in adults with cochlear implants. Design: Participants (n = 21 cochlear implant users) heard high- and low-context sentences that were played at the original speaking rate, as well as a slowed (1.4× duration) speaking rate, using uniform pitch-synchronous time warping. In addition to intelligibility measures, changes in pupil dilation were measured as a time-varying index of processing load or listening effort. Slope of pupil size recovery to baseline after the sentence was used as an index of resolution of perceptual ambiguity. Results: Speech intelligibility was better for high-context compared to low-context sentences and slightly better for slower compared to original-rate speech. Speech rate did not affect magnitude and latency of peak pupil dilation relative to sentence offset. However, baseline pupil size recovered more substantially for slower-rate sentences, suggesting easier processing in the moment after the sentence was over. The effect of slowing speech rate was comparable to changing a sentence from low context to high context. The effect of context on pupil dilation was not observed until after the sentence was over, and one of two analyses suggested that context had greater beneficial effects on listening effort when the speaking rate was slower. These patterns maintained even at perfect sentence intelligibility, suggesting that correct speech repetition does not guarantee efficient or effortless processing. With slower speaking rates, there was less variability in pupil dilation slopes following the sentence, implying mitigation of some of the difficulties shown by individual listeners who would otherwise demonstrate prolonged effort after a sentence is heard. Conclusions: Slowed speaking rate provides release from listening effort when hearing an utterance, particularly relieving effort that would have lingered after a sentence is over. Context arguably provides even more release from listening effort when speaking rate is slower. The pattern of prolonged pupil dilation for faster speech is consistent with increased need to mentally correct errors, although that exact interpretation cannot be verified with intelligibility data alone or with pupil data alone. A pattern of needing to dwell on a sentence to disambiguate misperceptions likely contributes to difficulty in running conversation where there are few opportunities to pause and resolve recently heard utterances.

The main aim of this study was to characterize the phonoarticulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and correlate it with clinical and genetic factors. Thirty-one patients with SCA3 who were subjected to spontaneous speech recordings and phonoarticulatory diadochokinesis (DDK) participated in the study. Speech analyses were performed starting after 10 s of spontaneous speech, by three experienced speech therapists, using a protocol for dysarthria adapted from the Mayo Clinic. The intra-evaluator reliability was analyzed. The lower the patient's age at disease onset was, the more frequent the occurrences of monofrequency and altered speech rhythm were. Articulation, DDK, resonance, and prosody showed a moderate correlation with the number of “CAG” triplet repeats. We conclude that the phonoarticulation of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is characterized by mixed dysarthrophonia with cerebellar and hypokinetic components, and that there is a tendency toward higher frequency of dysarthrophonia symptoms with lower age of disease onset, longer time since onset and higher number of “CAG” triplet repeats.},

However, a limited number of studies have investigated lingual function during speech production in this population. This study aimed to investigate lingual kinematics during speech production using electromagnetic articulography (AG-200 EMA). The PD group consisted of eight dysarthric speakers with PD and was matched with a group of eight controls. The tongue tip and tongue back movements of all participants during sentence production were recorded by EMA. Results showed that, perceptually, the participants with PD were mildly dysarthric. Kinematic results documented comparable (for alveolar sentence production) and increased (for velar sentence production) range of lingual movement in the PD group when compared to the control group. Lingual movement velocity, acceleration, and deceleration were also increased in the PD group, predominantly for the release phase of consonant production during sentence utterances. The PD group had longer duration in the production of alveolar consonant and comparable duration in the production of velar consonant. The results of the present study suggest the presence of impaired lingual control in individuals with PD. Increased range of articulatory movement, primarily in the release phase of consonant production, may account for articulatory imprecision in this population.},

The present study aimed to compare lingual kinematics during consonant production within a sentence in eight dysarthric (DPD) and seven nondysarthric (NDPD) speakers with PD with those of eleven nonneurologically impaired normal participants. The tongue tip and tongue back movements of the participants during sentence production were recorded using electromagnetic articulography (EMA). Results showed that both the DPD and NDPD had deviant articulatory movement during consonant production that resulted in longer duration of consonant production. When compared with the NDPD group, the DPD group primarily exhibited increased range of lingual movement and compatible duration of production with an accompanying increase in maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, and maximum deceleration. These findings are contrary to proposed theories that suggest articulatory imprecision in dysarthric speakers with PD is the outcome of reduced range of articulatory movement.},

An intraclass correlation approach was used to explicitly partition the “error free” between-subject variance and measurement error variance across repeated days (2) and across repeated trials (5). Ten healthy adults served as controls and 30 patients with diagnoses of multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, or Parkinson's disease served as subjects. The intraclass correlation analyses revealed generally high reliability (R greater than .90) for upper and lower lip force measurements, for various combinations of control and/or patient groups, and within each individual patient group. There was moderate correspondence between the quantitative measures of lip force and the clinical assessment of combined upper (r = .67) and lower lip closure force (r = .62) but low correspondence between the quantitative measures of lip force and the presence of motor speech deficit. The lower lip force of patients with Parkinson's disease (M = 3.1 N) on Day 1 was markedly reduced from that of all other patient groups and controls (M = 10.1 N). These results yield helpful information for the design of investigations of oral-motor weakness and for the quantitative assessment of an individual's clinical status.},

This paper investigates the phonetic encoding of prosodic structure from a corpus of scripted broadcast news speech in Amer-ican English through analysis of the acoustic cor-relates of prosodic boundary and their interaction with phrasal stress (pitch-accent) at three levels of prosodic structure: Word, ip, and IP. Evidence for acoustic effects of prosodic boundary is shown in measures of duration local to the domain-final rime. These findings provide strong evidence for prosodic theory, showing acoustic correlates of a 3-way dis-tinction in boundary level.},

Eight dysarthric speakers who represented a wide range of severity were recorded producing single words and sentences. Thirty-two college students performed the following intelligibility quantification tasks: percentage estimates, rating scale estimates, work and sentence transcriptions, word and sentence completions, and word and sentence multiple-choice tasks. Intelligibility scores for transcriptions were compared to estimates and to other objective tasks with the following results: (1) all measurement techniques, except word completion, rank ordered speakers similarly to transcriptions, (2) mean estimates of intelligibility closely parallel transcription scores, but dispersion of listener estimates was large, and (3) objective tasks form a hierarchy with speakers receiving lowest scores on transcriptions, intermediate scores on completions, and highest scores on multiple-choice tasks. Mean scores for words and sentences were similar. Implications of results for clinical management of dysarthria are discussed.},

Increases in intelligibility were initially achieved by control of speaking rate. A hierarchy of rate control strategies, ranging from a rigid imposition of rate through thythmic cueing to self-monitored rate control is discussed. As speakers improved their monitoring skills, a compromise was made between intelligibility and rate. Normal prosodic patterns were not achieved by the ataxic speakers due to difficulty in precisely coordinating the subtle fundamental frequency, loudness and timing adjustments needed to signal stress. Three of the four subjects were taught to use only durational adjustments to signal stress. In this way, they were able to achieve stress on targeted words consistently and minimize bizarreness which resulted from sweeping changes in fundamental frequency and bursts of loudness. The need for further clinically oriented research is discussed.},

Effects of rate control on sentence and phoneme intelligibility and speech naturalness were examined. Sentence intelligibility improved for both groups, with metered pacing conditions associated with the largest improvement in scores. Similar improvements as speaking rates were reduced were not seen for the phoneme intelligibility task; however, one must recognize that sentence and phoneme intelligibility tasks are different. Slowing the rate of dysarthric speakers did not have as marked an impact on speech naturalness as it did for normal speakers whose naturalness decreased at slowed rates. Metered rate control strategies were associated with the lowest ratings of naturalness for all subject groups. A potential explanation for the discrepancies between the findings for sentence and phoneme intelligibility is offered.},

  abstract = {This study presents the first acoustic examination of prominence relations in entire contours associated with different information structures in Egyptian Arabic. Previous work has shown that topics and foci are typically associated with different pitch events, whereas it is still a matter of debate whether and how Egyptian Arabic uses prominence relations to mark narrow focus. The analysis of data from 17 native speakers showed that narrow focus was marked by on-focus pitch expansion as well as post-focus compression. Post-focus compression was realized as a large downstep after focus, compressed pitch range, lower intensity and shorter duration. The results also showed further register lowering after a contrastive focus, but no further pitch boost of the focused word. By contrast, a contrastive topic showed higher scaling of the topic as well as an expanded pitch range of the overall contour. The findings of this study stress the significance of whole contours to convey intonational meanings, revealing gradient prominence cues to focus across the utterance, specifically post-focus register lowering to enhance the prominence of a contrastive focus.},
